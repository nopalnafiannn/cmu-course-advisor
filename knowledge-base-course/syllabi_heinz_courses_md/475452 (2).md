Course Description
Critical to the economic development professional’s toolkit is understanding how and why real estate is
developed: what motivates private real estate development, how real estate development is financed, market
drivers and the context by which private real estate developers and financiers operate, and the role of public
policy and public financing in achieving desired public outcomes.

In this class, you will explore the real estate development process, the context by which real estate is
developed, valuation and financing methodologies, and the role of the public in supporting private real estate
development through a combination of lecture, discussion, and guest speakers.

You will have fun building your real estate toolkit. You will meet and learn from practicing real estate
development professionals (including me!) and explore real world real estate developments. From main streets
to downtown office towers, you will gain a new appreciation and insight into how the places you live, work, and
play came to be. Your learning will be assessed through individual take-home assignments, a group case study,
class participation, and an in-class presentation. While there are no specific prerequisites for this course, you
should have basic Excel modeling skills and basic understanding of finance.

Learning Objectives
### When you have completed this course, you will be able to:

● Utilize Floor Area Ratio and leasable square feet calculations to develop a real estate program.
● Calculate Net Operating Income (NOI)
● Apply valuation methodologies and concepts to real world real estate development.
● Perform supportable debt analysis to build a real estate financing capital stack utilizing Net Operating
Income and real estate valuation methods.
● Create a pro forma real estate cash flow model, analyze economic returns and recognize key drivers and
inputs to your pro forma model.
● Articulate the role of the public in real estate development and critically analyze the appropriateness and
application of a variety of public real estate financing tools and methods-- including understanding real

estate financing ‘gaps.’
● Apply your newly acquired skill set and tool box to examine a real estate development opportunity and
recommend (in writing and oral presentation) a development program, financing capital stack (including any
public financing), pro forma model, economic returns. to a faux board of investors.

Learning Resources
● Textbooks:
● OPTIONAL Professional Real Estate Development, Principals and Process, Fourth Edition, Mike E.

Miles, Gayle L. Berens, Mark J. Eppli, Marc A. Weiss, Urban Land Institute
● Software: Excel
● You are encouraged to read real estate periodicals such as ULI Magazine, Business Times, New York
Times Real Estate section, Wall Street Journal, Pittsburgh Post Gazette, broker publications such as CBRE,
Colliers, and others on your own. Regularly reading about real world real estate issues in the public press
will help students build a mind set and framework as to their study and analysis of real estate development.

Public press clippings may be assigned from time to time to supplement your learning. You will choose a
real estate topic reported on in the public press to lead a brief discussion during some classes.

Attendance and participation 20%
### Individual take-home assignments:

Through the course you will receive 3 take-home written assignments. These assignments will assess your
mastery of certain technical aspects of real estate development, including:
## 1. FAR (Floor Area Ratio), efficiency, rentable square feet calculations.

## 2. Supportable debt analysis and building a financing capital stack utilizing Net Operating Income and real

estate valuation methods.
## 3. Real estate pro forma modeling using Excel and economic return analysis.

Each assignment will be completed individually and must be turned in on time (see late work policy). Generally,
each assignment will be a 1-2page written memorandum, Excel model (if necessary) and any supporting
materials.

You must complete these assignments to have the opportunity to receive full credit for this portion of your grade.
### Attendance and Participation:

Real estate development professionals actively engage in creative and technical discussion with a myriad of
stakeholders and professionals daily. This personal interaction is critical to the real development process.

Interaction among students, me, and guest speakers are valuable elements of the learning experience for this
class. Therefore, attendance and participation are worth 20% of the total grade; each unexcused absence will
result in a deduction of 5% of your overall grade.
### Participating means that you will:

● Attend class.
● Arrive to class on time.
● Engage thoughtfully in class discussions.
● Lead (with a small group) at least one 20-30 minute class discussion on a real estate development issue
reported in the public press.

In the case of special circumstances -- such as a doctor excused illness, observation of a religious holiday, or
personal emergency- an absence will be excused.

Please make every effort to be on time for class. A pattern of unexcused tardiness (more than one) may negatively
affect your overall assessment.

Please let me know in advance if you know you are going to miss class or need to be tardy.

Midpoint Quiz
Midway through the course students will take a graded quiz / brief exam on key concepts.
### Group Case Study:

A Group Case Study will be distributed. Depending on enrollment, the Group Case study will be completed by
teams of 3-5 students.

The Group Case Study requires you to apply the skills acquired through the class in a loosely defined real estate
development scenario to a faux board of investors. You will work in a group and be graded as a group.

Each Group will be required to provide a one-page description of the case and brief outline of what the team is
proposing to deliver. This will not be graded - but will serve as a checkpoint to help ensure you are on track to
# 90-748 Real Estate Development page 3

complete the Case Study.
### Minimum elements of the Case Study will include:

● Development program and budget -including FAR and rentable/leasable square foot calculations.
● Pro forma cash flow model
● Valuation analysis utilizing Net Operating Income and real estate valuation methodologies
● Recommended financing capital stack
● Articulation of potential economic returns
● Articulation and analysis of risk factors
● Recommend investing or not investing investor equity to proceed.

The Case Study will be presented in both a written and oral report. Each member of the team is required to present
some portion of the oral report. Teams are encouraged to be creative and think beyond the classroom in support of
their study. However, the minimum technical elements above must be included in the study.

Course Policies
● Academic Integrity & Collaboration: Please review CMU’s Academic Integrity Policy carefully
(http://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html). You will be held
accountable for any violations that come to my attention.

Collaboration
I encourage you to speak to each other! Real estate is a fun topic-- talking about what you are observing in the real
world, public press and topics we have covered in class is an important part of the learning process. In real world
practice, real estate development is a collaborative endeavor.

However, other than the Group Case Study and the small group led class discussion, all individual take home
assignments must be completed individually. You may collaborate on individual take home assignments-- but you
must declare in writing who you collaborated with and describe the nature of your collaboration.
● Accommodations for disabilities: Carnegie Mellon University is committed to providing reasonable
accommodations for all persons with disabilities. If you have a disability and require accommodations,
please contact the Office of Disability Resources access@andrew.cmu.edu. If you have an accommodations
letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with
me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as
appropriate.
● Statement on student wellness: Please remember to take care of yourself. Everyone experiences difficult
times and it important to seek help when you need it. As a student, you may experience a range of
challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use,
feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful
events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities.

● We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is
fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer
to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language,
sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or
genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the
perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity,
equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to
pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside
of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core
values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They
contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore,
the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of
identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has
passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions.

Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate
to be more equitable and just.
