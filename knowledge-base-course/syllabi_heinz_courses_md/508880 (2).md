Course Description
Data warehouses are the central component of a modern data stack. They have solved the problem
of analyzing massive amounts of structured & semi-structured data and are cost-effective,
performant and easy to use. Data warehouses are the foundation for reporting, ad hoc analysis,
business intelligence and machine learning, and enable collaboration among a diversity of users and
stakeholders across organizations of all sizes.

This class will provide students with the conceptual background and hands on keyboard skills
needed to utilize a data warehouse effectively. Throughout the course, students will work on an
end-to-end development project, building a working data platform for New York City transit data.

Using actual taxi, rideshare, bike share and weather data, students will answer real-world analytics
questions, such as "How does location and time of day affect trip length?" and "How does weather
affect transit preferences?". By the end, students will be empowered with the tools and techniques
needed to take a real-world data project from problem statement to prototype to production.

Prerequisites
95–703 A: Database Management. Basic knowledge of programming (Python strongly
recommended) and UNIX shell. Basic data analysis.

Learning Objectives
● Implement data ingest techniques (ETL)
● Transform data using dbt
● Maintain data quality
● Compare modern and classic strategies of data modeling
● Write advanced SQL for data analytics, including geographic and time series
● Understand data warehouse architecture
Students will develop secondary skills in software engineering, testing, benchmarking, version
control, reading technical resources, technology selection, and technical communication. They will
learn tools to think with as well as tools to code with, ensuring future career growth as the
technological landscape changes.

Weekly Course Schedule
● Friday morning: week N (current) video lectures posted; reading list finalized
● Sunday midnight EDT: week N-1(previous) homework due. deadline to request extension for week
N-1(previous) homework.
● Wednesday afternoon: week N-1(previous) homework graded & canonical solution posted
● Wednesday 7:30 PM EDT: week N (current) quiz due
● Wednesday 7:30 – 8:30 PM EDT: Live recitation on Zoom. Review week N-1(previous) homework &
homework kickoff for week N (current)
You should spend Sun/Mon/Tues/Wed watching lectures, doing readings & reviewing software
documentation before the live recitation Wednesday night. Spend Thurs/Fri/Sat/Sun working on homework.

Course Content
Recorded lectures will be posted to Canvas, along with slides, readings and supplemental materials. Prefer
the slides and any announcements over recordings in the event of conflicting information.

Coding Assignments
Each weekly coding assignment will be explained in a dedicated video lecture segment; see the
corresponding slides for links to tools and software documentation you should use.
● Grading is based separately on the work you do each week.
● Initial setup: create a new repo in your GitHub account (you) from template
● Weekly procedure
1. git tag week-1-start
2. <hack, hack, hack>
3. git tag week-1-end
## 4. In Canvas, submit URL to GitHub diff view:

https://github.com/you/cmu-95797/compare/week-1-start...week-1-end
● If you mess up the previous week, you can either:
*  manually integrate homework solution into your existing code base (be sure to tag
week-2-start afterwards, not before)
*  Start over by creating a new repo from the template (no penalty!)
Live recitations on Zoom will be used to discuss previous week's homework solutions and kick off The
current week’s coding assignment. Come prepared having already reviewed software documentation.

Assessments
### The final course grade will be calculated using the following categories:

### Assessment Percentage of Final Grade

Weekly quiz 10%
Participation 10%
Short answer questions 20%
Coding assignments 60%
● Weekly quizzes: “did you watch it?” - one question per recorded lecture segment
● Participation: “did you show up?” - 0 or 1 each week, full credit earned for any participation in weekly
recitations or on Canvas forum
● Short answer questions: “did you understand?” - answers can be found entirely in lectures and
readings; no outside research is required
● Coding assignments: “can you implement it?” - evaluated on correctness, readability &
comprehensibility, cleanliness, comments & documentation, and general software best practices
Students will be assigned the following final letter grades, based on calculations coming from the course
assessment section.

Grade Percentage Interval
A [90-100%)
B [80-90%)
C [70-80%)
D [60-70%)
R (F) <60%
Final grades will be curved to fit the overall distribution recommended by CMU Heinz.

Grading Policies
● Quizzes are due prior to weekly recitation at 7:30 EDT Wednesday.
● Homework is due midnight EDT Sunday night.
● Late-work policy: late work will not be accepted without prior extension from instructor
● Make-up work & regrading policy: make up work and regrading are not available.

Extension Policy
● One automatic extension will be granted if requested by email or Canvas message by midnight
EDT Sunday. You will have until noon EDT Wednesday to complete the assignment.
● Any late work will be penalized 10% per day.
● If you are entitled to additional accommodations due to a documented disability, you must notify the
instructor prior to the assignment due date.

Original Work Policy
This course maintains a strict citation/anti-plagiarism policy. If you quote or use material that you did not
create yourself (from webpages, lecture transcripts, open source or stack overflow code, etc.) you must
clearly cite the source of your material with a URL or other reference. You may use any citation style
you are familiar with or refer to the Chicago Manual Style.

Any copy and pasting without citation will be considered plagiarism and you will receive a score of
zero for that assignment or portion thereof.

Communication Policy
Use Piazza for class-related discussion here this term for all technical and homework questions. Use email
only for personal & individual communication with professor such as extensions & grading. Emails about
course content will not be answered.

Course Policies
● Academic Integrity & Collaboration: These are individual projects: discuss with your classmates
(preferably on Canvas) but do your own work.
● Consent to record: Live recitations on Zoom will be recorded and distributed to other students in
this class section for review purposes; by attending recitation, you agree to such recording. If you do
not wish to be recorded, please contact the professor.
● Accommodations for students with disabilities: If you have a disability and require
accommodations, please contact Catherine Getchell, Director of Disability Resources,
# 412-268-6121, getchell@cmu.edu. If you have an accommodations letter from the Disability

Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in
the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as
appropriate.
● Statement on student wellness: As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can
interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling
down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful
events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily
activities. CMU services are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about
confidential mental health services available on campus at: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Support
is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412-268-2922.
