# 93-858: Market Research in the Entertainment Industry

## Course Information

**Units:** 3

## Description

This course will cover the primary applications of market research by entertainment companies, using the film industry as the template for this coverage, with the recognition that the principles and concepts discussed in the class are basic to good research practices in any business or industry, and are fundamental to research employed in the television, music, gaming and other entertainment industries. My hope is that this class will be both enlightening and enjoyable. My goal is that by the end of this class you will be ready to be well-informed consumers of research at whatever company or occupation you go on to after graduation. This class is not intended to prepare you for careers in market research, although several recent graduates of this program have found jobs at research companies. Rather, it is meant to equip you with the knowledge you will need to understand and evaluate the research findings you will encounter as entertainment industry executives. The more you know about how research is conducted, what it can and cannot do, and what is required for any research project to be valid and useful, the better able you will be to benefit from it.
