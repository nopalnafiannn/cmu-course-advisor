### Systems: Applying Artificial Intelligence to

Healthcare
Mini 4, Spring 2025 (3 units), Room TBD
Instructor: David Steier, PhD (steier@andrew.cmu.edu)
TA: TBD
Classes held in person from 9 AM- 4:30 PM on Sunday March 30 and Saturday April 12, and from 9 AM until
noon on Saturday April 19
Overview
This course will give students with no previous experience in artificial intelligence a chance to learn
about applications of AI to health care. Drawing on consulting experience for healthcare clients, this
course will survey several real-life healthcare applications of AI capabilities, including predictive
modeling, social network analysis, computer vision, and large language models. For students with
experience in programming, one of the final project options will be the creation of a large language
model for creation of patient discharge letters. Another option is the description of an AI healthcare
application and a critical evaluation of claims made by researchers or vendors for that application.

Course Learning Outcomes
### The main learning objectives of the course are to:

## 1. Describe a range of real-world applications of AI to healthcare including both achievements and

challenges faced.
## 2. Understand why large language models have generated such excitement for health care, along

with limitations and risks of the technology.
## 3. Apply a range of techniques for evaluating AI healthcare applications.

Course Prerequisites
Prerequisites: None, but a basic knowledge of statistics (such as statistical significance) will be helpful for
the material on evaluating applications.

Instructor: David Steier (PhD, CMU SCS ‘89)
David Steier joined the CMU faculty in 2018 as a Distinguished Service Professor in the Heinz College
School of Information Systems and Management. He teaches courses on data science for product
management, managing analytics projects, designing smart systems and artificial intelligence. Prior to
joining CMU, David was Managing Director in Deloitte Consulting's Data Science practice. At Deloitte,
David helped clients use advanced data analytics and visualization in a variety of industries including
health care, banking, retail, manufacturing, telecommunications, media and the public sector. Prior to
Deloitte, David was Director in the Center for Advanced Research at PwC, Senior Director of Technology
and Business Development at Kanisa, and Managing Director at Scient. David was also a Continuing
Lecturer at the University of California Berkeley's School of Information, where he was course lead for
the capstone class in the Masters in Information and Data Science program. David holds a Ph.D. in
computer science from CMU and a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Purdue University.
### Course Resources and Policies

Canvas
An online site with the syllabus, selected readings, and other resources will be on Canvas at <<<>>>.

Rather than emailing questions, students are encouraged to post questions on Canvas, so that other
students can see the answers and join in discussions as needed.

Readings
There is no textbook for the course. Online readings as listed below are required.

Grading
Grading in this class will be based on class participation, a quiz, and a final project. The class
participation portion of the grade (20%) is based on attendance and participation in discussions at all
three sessions (two in-person and one online). The quiz (20%) will be administered over Zoom. The final
project to be done by team will count for 60% of the grade: 10 % for the project proposal due April 10th,
25% for the final presentation on April 20th, and 25% for the final report due April 24th. There is no final
exam for this class. Grading is on a straight scale: 90.0% and above is an A, 80.0% and above is a B, and
so on (no rounding up). Everyone taking the class should expect to register for a letter grade. Auditing the class
or taking the class Pass/Fail is intended for extremely rare circumstances and only with consent of the instructor.

A+ 98.0-100% B+ 88.0-89.9% C+ 78.0-79.9%
A 92.0-97.9% B 82.0-87.9% C 72.0-77.9%
A- 90.0-91.9% B- 80.0-81.9% C- 70.0-71.9%
Course Outline
This is a “micro-mini” course taught in person on three days: from 9 AM- 4:30 PM on Sunday March 30 and
Saturday April 12, and from 9 AM until noon on Saturday April 19

Academic Integrity
Students are expected to strictly follow Carnegie Mellon University rules of academic integrity in
this course. This means in particular that unless otherwise specified, homework are to be the
work of the individual student using only permitted material and without any cooperation of other
students or third parties. It also means that usage of work by others is only permitted in the
form of quotations and any such quotation must be distinctively marked to enable identification
of the student’s own work and own ideas. All external sources used must be properly cited,
including author name(s), publication title, year of publication, and a complete reference needed
for retrieval. The same work may not be submitted for credit in multiple courses. Violations will
be penalized to the full extent mandated by the CMU policies. There will be no exceptions.

Diversity
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by
this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the
diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my
intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality,
disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are
encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the
course for you personally or for other students or student groups.

Disability Accommodations
If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office,
I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester
as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If
you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not
yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at
access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Mental Health
As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such
as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty
concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may
diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities.

CMU services are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential
mental health services available on campus at: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Support is
always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412-268-2922.
