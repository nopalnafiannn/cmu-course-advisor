Prerequisites Students should have completed a statistics course. Students may wish to review the fundamentals of
statistics and probability in the free online learning class at
https://oli.cmu.edu/courses/probabilitystatistics-open-free/ . Proficiency with at least one analysis
environment (e.g. Excel, Python, R, or SAS) required. Experience with advanced analytics (data science,
artificial intelligence) highly desirable.

Description With the growing demand for data science and AI skills, there are many options for students to learn
fundamentals of data and analytics modeling. There are fewer opportunities to learn how to manage
analytics projects, which often involve leading teams with diverse skills and interacting with stakeholders
in a variety of roles. Using a decision-driven framework, this course offers students practical guidance
and experience around the process of initiating, delivering, and evaluating analytics projects. It will draw
on experience from a consulting perspective, talking about analytics with clients and delivering analytics
related engagements.
### The course will cover the following topics:

● Starting the analytics conversation: Identifying needs, understanding constraints
● Planning and executing analytics projects: Sizing, staffing, communication
● Making choices around data, analytics, visualizations and infrastructure: Sourcing, techniques,
technologies, integration, security, pipelines
● Analytics in the enterprise: Communications, ethics, organizing talent, strategy
Course There is no textbook covering all the material in this course, so we will be using a selection of material

Evaluation The grade will be based on three homework assignments, active participation in class discussions
## Method including in-class group exercises, and the completion and presentation of an analytical project

management case study. The in-class exercises will refine the student skills over time on a variety of case
studies taken from analytics practice. The homework assignments, based on the analytics problem chosen
for the final project, will cover problem framing, project planning, data, analytic, and visualization
techniques. The grades for homework turned in after the deadline will be reduced by 10% per day late.
● Homework (3 times 20%) 60%
● Class participation 20%
● Final project 20%

Course Policies In person attendance in the Hamburg 2009 sessions is expected, otherwise live (synchronous) attendance on
& Expectations Zoom is required. Viewing a recording of a Zoom session does not count as live participation. While one
excused absence is permitted, missing more classes will affect the class participation grade in proportion to
the number of classes missed.

Students are expected to strictly follow Carnegie Mellon University rules of academic integrity in this
course. This means in particular that unless otherwise specified, homework are to be the work of the
individual student using only permitted material and without any cooperation of other students or third
parties. It also means that usage of work by others is only permitted in the form of quotations and any such
quotation must be distinctively marked to enable identification of the student’s own work and own ideas.

All external sources used must be properly cited, including author name(s), publication title, year of
publication, and a complete reference needed for retrieval. Violations will be penalized to the full extent
mandated by the CMU policies. There will be no exceptions.

You may use generative AI programs like ChatGPT during the brainstorming and idea generation phase for
assignments. However, doing so cannot be considered a substitute for traditional research. Generative AI
programs rely on predictive models to generate content that may appear correct, but has been shown to
sometimes be incomplete, inaccurate, taken without attribution from other sources, and / or biased. Any
information generated by an AI program should be cited like any other reference material. You are
ultimately responsible for the content of the information you submit. However, you may not attempt to pass
off any work generated by an AI program as your own.

Homework assignments will often cover material before it has been covered in class, with the goal of
motivating students to use the readings and other resources and bring their questions to class. The
homework assignments are a chance to apply best efforts to the problem at hand, and feedback from the
class discussion can be incorporated into the final project paper and presentation. In many instances,
especially on the case studies, there may not be a single right answer: students are encouraged to explore a
topic from a variety of perspectives and techniques and engage in respectful and open-minded discussion of
alternatives.

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring
to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities
that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and
culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the
effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I
encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I
will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may
have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of
Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained
relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of
motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance
and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and treatment does
work. You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus at
http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/ . Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological
Services: 412-268-2922.
