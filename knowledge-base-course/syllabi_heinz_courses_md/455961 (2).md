Course Description
Communication in written form is an essential element of management. Writing for businessfocused, industry-specific contexts differs from academic writing. Accordingly, this course
focuses on teaching transferable, career-enhancing writing skills: developing essential and
persuasive content, applying logic, organizing information, targeting diverse audiences with
varying levels of expertise and roles, addressing feasibility, ensuring clarity, controlling tone,
maintaining format norms and designing documents for readability. The course challenges
students to meet readers’ needs by conveying critical thinking via anticipating the perspectives of
stakeholders in professional situations. Coursework emphasizes precise, concise phrasing in
actionable communications. Digital tips and strategies for collaborative writing will be
discussed. Writing resources and sample documents will be
provided.

Note: This course assumes proficiency in English grammar. Numerous resources for improving
written English skills are provided via Canvas.

Registration
Once a section is full, enrollment is dependent on: (1) the number of registered students who
drop the section, and (2) the waitlist order. Students who miss the first class meeting can be
automatically dropped from the course. After the initial session, registration is closed.

Classroom Policies
Professional conduct is necessary. Demonstrate respect for everyone in the room through active
listening, eye contact, and productive comments. As this is a writing course, rather than a course
on public policy, avoid policy debates. Further, while class is in session, refrain from: accessing
personal messages, sleeping, or doing other coursework. Overall, students are expected to exhibit
an interest in professional development beyond simply completing the assignments.
# CLASS ATTENDANCE

This course consists of lectures, discussions, individual writing exercises and peer review.

Students are responsible for obtaining course material distributed during their absence. For
students with 4 or more unexcused absences, the result will be a full drop in letter grade.

An unexcused absence is any absence where the instructor was not informed beforehand, with
the exception of extraordinary circumstances.
# WELLNESS

Carnegie Mellon University has a wide array of resources and programs to support student
wellness. Students are encouraged to access these resources, and to contact the instructor if a
health or safety concern arises.
# TEACHING ASSISTANT

The teaching assistant’s contact information will be posted on Canvas. Feel free to proactively
schedule sessions (at least 2 business days in advance) with the TA for feedback on your work.

Think of the TA as a professional coach; the role is intended to provide guidance and offer
resources for developing effective presentations – ultimately, you are responsible for the work
you deliver in class.

Written Assignments
Instructions for written assignments will be posted to Canvas. Please review the assignment
schedule for rough draft and final draft due date for each assignment upload.
# PURPOSE OF DRAFTS

Drafts serve as preparation for individual meetings with instructor or the TA and for peer-review
sessions for feedback prior to submitting the final, graded version. Further, drafts are useful for
time management. Drafts are graded upon completion. Grade deductions will occur if a draft is
incomplete, or if there is a lack of participation during the guided editing sessions.

# LATE ASSIGNMENT POLICY

If a student submits a paper late, the student may be jeopardizing their ability to receive
comments on the first and final draft.

While allotments can be made for extenuating circumstances, if the assignment is handed in late,
half of a letter grade will be deducted from the overall score, for every day past the due date. For
instance, if you submit an assignment two days late, then the highest grade you can receive is
90%.
# POLICY ON EXTENSIONS

Late assignments earn a failing grade unless: (1) a religious observance or a documented medical
condition prevents on-time submission; and, (2) the student consulted with the instructor in
advance for approval of an alternate due date.
### Policy on Student Accommodations

The Carnegie Mellon University Office of Disability Resources reviews requests for “reasonable
accommodations, academic adjustments, and auxiliary aids and services.”[1] Students can work
with the instructor to arrange accommodations as needed on a case-by-case basis once
accommodations are granted by the Office of Disability Resources.

Global Communication Center (GCC)
The GCC provides communication consulting free-of-charge. Use this resource, located on
campus in Hunt Library, to enhance your academic performance: https://www.cmu.edu/gcc/.

Bonus Points
Because this is a writing and communications class, participation in course discussion and
activities is a valuable aspect of the course. As such, the instructor will award bonus points to
those students – at their discretion – in the following circumstances: (1) being a constructive and
regular contributor to class discussions and (2) providing meaningful involvement in writing
exercises, class activities, and peer review.

Academic Conduct
Assignments are submitted via Turnitin. This technology compares documents with contact
available on the internet and with files previously uploaded. The site generates a report
indicating matching content. If an academic integrity violation is suspected, the student will be
contacted to meet with the instructor to determine if a violation has occurred based on Carnegie
### Mellon University’s Policy on Academic Integrity. Not that plagiarism includes:

### *  Presenting another writer’s work as your own

### *  Cutting and pasting contact verbatim without using quotation marks to indicate a direct

quote
### *  Inserting a direct quote or paraphrasing without citing the source

### *  Providing incomplete or incorrect information about the source cited

### *  Over-relying on templates or another writers’ phrasing

Disclaimer: The instructor reserves the right to change any provision of this course outline
including but not limited to the right to change the time, order, and content of the course
schedule.
