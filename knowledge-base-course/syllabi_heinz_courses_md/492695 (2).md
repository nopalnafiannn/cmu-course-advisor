# LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

We acknowledge that the land we occupy today in and around Pittsburgh has for
centuries been home to Indigenous peoples, including the Adena, followed by the
Hopewell, and later the Monongahela, who occupied the region until the late 17th century.

At the turn of the 18th century, several tribes driven off lands from other parts of the
country traveled through, conducted trade, and/or settled in the area. We acknowledge
the Haudenosaunee (also known as the Iroquois or the Five Nations peoples comprising
the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca), the Lenape (also known as the
Delaware peoples), the Shawnee, and the Osage peoples, whose ancestral territory
includes this land. We also acknowledge the genocide and forceable removal of millions
of Indigenous peoples from these lands as European colonizers in the 18th century
fought for control of the region. Today, the Pittsburgh area continues to be home for
Indigenous peoples of many nations. We strive to honor their rights, acknowledge their
histories, and work together toward a shared future.
# COURSE DESCRIPTION

Arts organizations, many of which are nonprofit, aim to provide a strong mission,
vibrant programming, and meaningful community engagement. Even at the smallest
organization, this takes people (staff and/or volunteers). Budgets and staff sizes
typically preclude a formal Human Resources department. However, these
organizations are still subject to many of the same employment laws, regulations, best
practices, and workplace issues as their much larger or for profit counterparts.

Handling these questions falls to the organization’s leadership, who have competing
demands on time and priorities and minimal resources.

This course seeks to address that gap, in order to equip students with a basic, practical
understanding of workplace issues that exist in arts nonprofit organizations. Beyond
the nuts and bolts of HR and employment law, students will explore the creation and
maintenance of a positive, productive working environment that centers equity and
inclusion. Class discussion and assignments will address complexities in modern
# 93-834 Intro to Business Law for Arts Managers II

3:30 - 4:50 PM, Monday and Wednesday
Spring 2025, Mini 3 – Heinz College
nonprofit administration, including relationship to mission and values, DEAI, hybrid
workplaces, pay equity, workplace culture, the role of technology and social media, and
board relationships, among other topics. Assignments focus heavily on real-world
challenges, requiring practical interpretation and implementation.
# COURSE STRUCTURE

This course utilizes a series of readings, lectures, discussions, and practical exercises.

Readings and online assignments provide an important foundation on key topics and
must be completed prior to each class. Lectures, in-class discussions, and exercises
provide opportunities to further engage with the content. Assignments will apply and
assess student learning in a range of topics. Additional information regarding this
course can be found in this syllabus and posted in Canvas. Course-related assignments
and other details will also be discussed in class.
# COURSE OBJECTIVES

Skills and knowledge gained through this course will be assessed through participation
in discussions and course-related assignments. Upon the successful conclusion of the
course, students will be able to:

# COURSE EXPECTATIONS

Statement of Diversity in the Learning Environment: We are diverse in many ways, and
this course aims to foster an open and respectful learning environment that builds and
maintains an equitable and inclusive community. Topics covered may be difficult at
times, and it is expected that we approach our discussions with care, humility, and
empathy. As we work together to ensure a safe and more inclusive classroom
environment, I ask that we use active listening techniques, remove peripheral
distractions, reinforce one conversation at a time, remain open to new ways of thinking
and other’s perspectives, and foster opportunities for feedback that is honest and
intends to bring out the best in one another.

Transitioning Our Class to Zoom: My work schedule or other circumstances may
occasionally require a switch to Zoom. Should this occur, you will receive an email from
me as early as possible, with an announcement published on the Canvas site. It is highly
recommended that you turn on your Canvas notifications to ensure you are kept
informed.

Time Needed for Assignments/Class Preparation: Students should plan for individual
class preparation (readings, videos, review of prior lecture notes, and/or responses to
online prompts) to take approximately 1-2 hours per class. Time needed for individual
assignments will vary depending on the assignment.

Intellectual and Professional Integrity: Students at Carnegie Mellon University are
preparing for professional activity of the highest standards, including the highest
standards of ethics and integrity. You are expected to have read and understood the
Student Handbook and to conduct yourself in a professional manner, both inside and
outside the classroom, particularly as representatives of this course, the Master of Arts
Management Program, Heinz College, and Carnegie Mellon University.

Misrepresentation of another’s work as your own (e.g., plagiarism and cheating) is
widely recognized as a very serious matter. The University views cases of cheating and
plagiarism as extremely serious. Students found to have cheated or plagiarized on an
assignment will receive a zero on the assignment, and information about the offense
will be submitted to the Dean’s office for review. Severe penalties may be imposed, up
to and including expulsion.
# COURSE POLICIES

Facial Coverings: Our in-person course will follow University policies regarding COVID19 and other health issues. At this time, the University does not require facial
coverings. I ask that you respect the decision of your fellow students regarding facial
coverings, and that you follow the CDC’s guidance for when a facial covering is
recommended.

Technology: This class may involve the occasional use of technology (laptops, tablets
and phones) during class. Please keep your technology tools charged and nearby for
use when designated. All personal matters requiring email, messaging, texts, other
homework, etc. should be handled outside of class.

Software: Software for the course will primarily include Canvas and tools available in the
Microsoft Office and/or Google suites. Occasional use of Zoom may also occur. If you
have concerns about utilizing any of these tools, please contact me.

Recordings: Students are allowed to record class sessions only with the instructor’s
advance, written permission – please contact me if necessary. If permitted, recordings
are only for your personal use. Distribution of any recording is prohibited. This is to
protect your FERPA rights and those of your fellow colleagues.

Food/Drink in Class: Please feel free to bring food, bottled beverages, and coffee/tea to
class. However, please ensure that your food and beverage consumption is done safely
and is not a distraction to others (e.g., noisy wrappers, pungent food, etc.). Please clean
up after yourself.

Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: If you identify as someone with
disability and are registered with the Office of Disability Resources, please use their
online system to notify me of your accommodations and to make arrangements to
discuss your needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to
ensure that appropriate accommodations are provided. If you believe that you may have
a disability and could benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the
Office of Disability Resources, please contact the Office at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Student Academic Success Center: CMU’s Student Academic Success Center offers a
wide variety of resources to help support student learning. These resources include
academic coaching, peer tutoring, communication support, and language and crosscultural support. For more information, visit: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/.

Students’ Health and Well-Being: Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a
healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough
sleep, and taking time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with
stress. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events,
or feelings like anxiety or depression, you are strongly encouraged to seek support.

Spring 2025, Mini 3 – Heinz College
### Total Possible Points 100

All written assignments are practical exercises based on a hypothetical nonprofit arts
center. More information will be provided on Canvas.

For Participation and Discussion: Consistent and thoughtful engagement with the
assigned reading materials and in-class discussion is a crucial path to learning. The
participation grade thus serves as a way to credit you with the time and work you put in,
both in and outside of the classroom. However, I recognize that comfort level with inclass discussion can vary. Accordingly, there are four discussion prompts/exercises
assigned throughout the course, with short written responses submitted through
Canvas and/or discussed in class. Each prompt is worth 3 points.
# GRADING SCALE

Students will be assigned the following final letter grades based on the points available
for each assignment and the “Grading Policies.” Grading scale for this course is as
follows:
A+ 98-100 B+ 87-89 C+ 77-79 R Below 71
### Exceptional Good Poor Failing

A 94-97 B 83-86 C 73-76 I Incomplete
### Excellent Acceptable Very Poor

A- 90-93 B- 80-82 C- 71-72
### Very Good Fair Minimum Passing

# GRADING POLICIES

Attendance: A great deal of information and guidance is presented during class;
therefore, attendance is required at every class. It is understood, however, that a
religious observance, job interview, or other circumstances may impact a student’s
ability to attend a class session. It is recommended that students look ahead at the
syllabus and inform the instructor by email at least 12 hours in advance of their
anticipated absence. Everyone is permitted one absence in this course. After the first
unexcused absence, the student’s overall letter grade for the course is subject to
reduction by half a grade. If there are extenuating circumstances that require a student
to miss more than one class session, please make arrangements to discuss the matter
in advance; I would like to find a way to support you.

Late Arrivals/Leaving Early/Frequent Class Departures: Arriving late, leaving early, or
leaving mid-class for extended breaks are unacceptable because it disrupts the class.

Two instances of arriving late, leaving mid-class, or leaving early without permission
will count as one absence. If there are extenuating circumstances, please make
arrangements to discuss the matter in advance.

Missed Classes: Students are responsible for any material they miss in class. Please
review Canvas and discuss with a classmate who can inform you of any missed
material, or please contact the instructor in advance of any foreseeable absences (as
# 93-834 Intro to Business Law for Arts Managers II

3:30 - 4:50 PM, Monday and Wednesday
Spring 2025, Mini 3 – Heinz College
outlined in the attendance policy), so that you may continue your course work.

Assignments and Late Work: Due dates for every assignment are provided on the
syllabus and posted in Canvas. Unless otherwise stated, all assignments shall be
completed on time. Submissions are due via Canvas when noted. Unexcused late work
will be accepted up to 48 hours after the deadline, but with a maximum 50% of the total
points for that assignment available (i.e., automatically reduced to half credit and then
graded appropriately). To request an exemption to this policy, which is approved in the
instructor’s discretion, please inform me by email as soon as possible, and in advance of
the deadline if possible.
