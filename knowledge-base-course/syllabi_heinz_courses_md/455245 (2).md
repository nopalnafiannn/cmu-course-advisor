# 90872 - Using R for Policy Data Analysis

(6 units)
Adjunct Professor: M William Sermons (msermons@andrew.cmu.edu , 301-499-5018)
Carnegie Mellon University
### Heinz College - School of Public Policy and Management

Fall 2024 Mini 1, Tuesday, 6:00 – 8:50 p.m.
### Office Hours:

Professor Sermons will create an online sign-up calendar that allows students to schedule
assistance during weekends and weekdays. You can also request appointments outside these
times as needed.
### Course Description/Objective:

Data analysis is an essential component of quantitative policy analysis. However, the focused
application of statistical methods extends beyond what is covered in core methods classes such
as Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Program Evaluation. This course teaches students how to
apply a variety of data analysis techniques using R, a free open-source statistical and graphical
analysis environment increasingly used by data miners and analysts.

A key focus of this course is the use of categorical variables, with a specific emphasis on
documenting and quantifying disparities across demographic lines such as race, gender, and
other important factors. Students will learn to apply these techniques broadly, with disparities
analysis serving as a real-world example.

Class sessions will combine instruction on data analysis techniques, in-class application using R,
and presentations by practicing policy data analysts. Applications will focus on analysis relevant
to the social safety net, including cases that emphasize consumer protection, affordable
housing, homelessness, and quantifying disparities.
### By the end of this course, students will:

*  Master the basics of R programming, including data types, structures, and manipulation.
*  Develop skills in data visualization and statistical analysis using R.
### *  Learn to identify and quantify disparities across various demographic lines or other

categorical variables.
### *  Gain experience in using AI tools for code generation and structured prompt

engineering.

### *  Complete an independent data analysis project demonstrating the application of course

concepts.
### Text Materials:

There is no required textbook for this course. However, links to relevant videos and Data
Carpentry pages will be provided via Canvas. Additionally, a course page created by the library
with links to further materials can be accessed here: Heinz College: 90-872 Using R for Public
Data Analysis.
### Prerequisite Skills:

Students are expected to have completed a course in statistics and have a basic understanding
of R. Familiarity with basic statistical concepts such as measures of central tendency, t-tests,
analysis of variance, and regression analysis is required. For students who have not taken a
statistics course with R, a review of the Introduction to R recording (passcode: 7#wQBTWQ) is
recommended.
### Weekly Schedule:

Each week, the course will include three types of activities: asynchronous pre-work, in-class
activities, and homework assignments.
### *  Asynchronous Pre-Work: Focused on applying course concepts using R, students will

review R Notebooks with explanatory text and executable R code before class.
### *  In-Class Activities: Weekly sessions will include mini-lectures, guest speakers,

discussions, and demonstrations of R application challenges. Class time is from 6:00 to
8:50 p.m., though we may routinely finish early.
### *  Homework Assignments: These include replicating analyses demonstrated in the

asynchronous R Notebook, participating in online discussions, and progressing on the
course project.

A- 91.0-93.9% B- 81.0-83.9% C- 71.0-73.9%
### Attendance Policy:

Students are expected to attend all classes. One excused absence may be granted for illness,
personal emergencies, or apprenticeship-related travel with prior arrangement. Unexcused
absences will result in a 5% deduction from the final grade. Assignments due on the day of a
missed class must still be submitted on time.
### Cheating & Plagiarism:

Students are expected to honor the letter and the spirit of the Carnegie Mellon University
Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism. All activities cited in that policy will be treated as cheating in
this course. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with this policy. Students are also
encouraged to review the Carnegie Mellon University Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview
for Graduate Students, which details penalties and sanctions, as well as students’ rights. I will
take a zero-tolerance policy on cheating and plagiarism and will consult with departmental
leadership on appropriate action for all instances of cheating and plagiarism. As the
aforementioned policies indicate, penalties can include course failure, suspension, and
dismissal from the program.

### Use of Generative AI:

Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, can be valuable for learning and productivity,
including completing assignments, generating ideas, and personalizing your learning
experience. However, proper citation and adherence to academic integrity guidelines are
required.
### In this class, you may use generative AI programs to:

*  Brainstorm ideas for your course project.
*  Evaluate, debug, and improve your R code.
*  Research topics or generate different ways to discuss a problem.
*  Review and edit written text for course assignments.
### You may not use generative AI programs to:

*  Generate content for assignments without proper quotation and citation.

### Page 4 of 5

*  Produce unresearched bibliographies or other uncited content.
*  Use generative AI content as your own without appropriate acknowledgment.

Important Considerations: It is important to recognize that large language models frequently
provide users with incorrect information, create professional-looking citations that are not real,
generate contradictory statements, incorporate copyrighted material without appropriate
attribution, and can sometimes integrate biased concepts. Code generation models may
produce inaccurate outputs. Image generation models may create misleading or offensive
content.

While you may use these tools in the work you create for this class, it is important to
understand that you are ultimately responsible for the content you submit. Work that is
inaccurate, biased, unethical, offensive, plagiarized, or incorrect will be penalized.
### Data Sets for Exercises and Projects:

In-class demonstrations will use the American Housing Survey. Students are required to select a
public microsample database, such as the American Community Survey or National Health
Interview Survey, for their assignments. The selected data source must be publicly accessible,
use individual or household-level data, and have no restrictions on circulation.
