Introduction
This course is a combination actual consulting engagement, research project, and lab where we encourage
you to try new approaches and techniques to successfully complete the engagement. It will help anyone
interested in a consulting career acquire new skills in everything from scoping to asking high-value, incisive
questions, to building strong, long-term client relationships. It may also help you decide if consulting is, in fact, a
good career choice for you (it’s not for everyone).

We’ll focus on how to move through the stages of a consulting engagement, on how to apply a methodology
that we’ve developed inside ConsultingLab (called, appropriately enough, “The ConsultingLab Way”) to help
you approach and manage engagements, and on the unwritten, “soft” skills that are the foundation of a
successful consulting career.

Course Goals
### *  Get you comfortable with the consulting environment;

### *  Give you immediately-applicable consulting skills to apply;

### *  Expose you to a variety of consulting situations and activities, including analyzing RFPs, team participation

and leadership, project management, critical thinking, creative solution, design thinking, presentation skills,
“reading” clients, and developing effective relationships;
### *  Have you come out a more prepared, confident, and comfortable professional, able to present yourself

and your solutions more clearly, powerfully, and effectively, and add value to the consultant-client
relationship at every stage.
### *  Most important, you’ll work on a real assignment, for a real client, that will have a real deliverable, and have

real impact.

More information on the projects can be found in the “Project Start Forms” folder in the “Files” section of
Canvas.

Teams will be formed by the TA based on your preferences (look in “Announcements” on Canvas for the link),
skillsets required on each project, collaborative opportunities, and creative randomness, just like in, you know, a
consulting firm.

Texts and readings
Many books and readings will be mentioned during the course. None are required, but all will be helpful should
you choose a career in consulting (or even if you don’t). Suggested below are three of my favorites. Note than
none are “consulting” book; there are plenty of those to look at, of varying quality and usefulness.
*  Making Things Happen, Scott Berkun, O’Reilly Media, 2008. ISBN-13: 978-0596517717. CMU alum Scott Berkun
wrote one of the best books I’ve read on the “whole” of project management, not just the techniques.
*  The Art of the Start, Guy Kawasaki, Portfolio Hardcover, 2004. ISBN-13: 978-1591840565. Guy is a former Apple
“low badge number” and largely responsible for their evangelism program. He’s now a Silicon Valley VC
whose lessons in starting a business are applicable to staring any project.
*  The Brand You 50, Tom Peters, Knopf, 1999. ISBN-13: 978-0375407727. Tom Peters is a legendary
“management guru” whose books are almost always instant classics. The point – that “you are your
projects” -- is one of the best lessons that you’ll learn about consulting, and life. His other two “50” books --
The Project 50 and The Professional Service Firm 50 – are just as essential.

Grading
Attendance: You will be randomly placed into a team responsible for a real project with a real client who
expects a real outcome (and you will be graded accordingly). You are part of a team. Your participation on
the project and interaction with the team is elemental in the real world and, since this is a real-world
engagement, your participation (or lack of it) will have a profound impact on your grade. If you are unwilling or
unable to make this commitment to your team, your client, and the course, drop the course.

Scheme: Here’s how your grade gets decided:
### Sprint Reports & Lab Notes: 5%

Mid-term presentation: 15%
### Final Engagement Presentation: 20%

Research Report: 10%
Client deliverable: 20%
Client evaluation: 15%
Team evaluation: 15%
94803/94403 ConsultingLab | Spring, 2025 Professor Chris Labash
Course outline, syllabus, and schedule
The standard grading scale applies, which means that to get an “A”, you must be perfect: perfect on every
individual and team assignment. Here’s the grading scale, per the Heinz College Handbook, Section 5.1:
A+: 4.33
A: 4.00
A-: 3.67
B+: 3.33
B: 3.00
B-: 2.67
C+: 2.33
C: 2.00
C-: 1.67
Extra Credit
There are multiple reasons, especially in team projects, where you might want to augment your grade with an
extra credit assignment. Contact the professor or TA for information.

Academic Integrity
In other words, cheating. And we can be very clear about what cheating is (and if you have any question
about whether something would be considered cheating, ask me)…
Cheating: “intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in
any academic exercise.”
Fabrication : “intentional and unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in an
academic exercise.”
Plagiarism: “deliberate adoption or reproduction of ideas or words or statements of another person as
one’s own without acknowledgement.”
…about the University’s policy toward cheating…
http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Cheating.html
…about the best ways for you to not feel compelled to cheat (not that you would)…
Prioritize your work: time management is your friend.

Own your own work: Be proud of your work. Why would you want to take credit for someone else’s?

Always cite your sources.

Get help: When you have trouble, get help from Instructors or TAs.
94803/94403 ConsultingLab | Spring, 2025 Professor Chris Labash
Course outline, syllabus, and schedule
…and most important, of the overriding ethical consequence: when you cheat you diminish your self (yes, in
the psycho-philosophical sense), you devalue your work, and you dishonor your community and your history.

Whoa.

Of more immediate relevance might be this: cheat in my class and I will at the least lower your grade by one
letter; the more likely outcome is that I will fail you. So seriously, why would you plagiarize, fabricate, or cheat in
any way?

Academic Rigor
Like many (and I hope most) people, I am deeply troubled by the attitude of indifference towards evidence,
the sophomoric fact-checking (if it happens at all), and the acceptance of outright lies that are prevalent in
current global culture: witness the number of Britons who in 2016 voted to leave the EU and only afterwards
searched Google for an explanation of what the EU was; or the nonchalance with which supporters of Donald
Trump accept his continual outright lies; and don't even get me started on vaccines, GMOs, gluten, or gun
control. This penchant for ignorance is particularly noticeable in United States’ culture and current political
climate and has deep, far-reaching, and profoundly disturbing present and future impact.

I couldn’t care less what political, religious, social, or other existential affiliation you have, but I cannot abide
stupidity, laziness, or sloppiness. What this means in practical terms is that everything that you present in this
class must be based on solid, vetted, verified, trusted, current, neutral evidence: solid academic research,
business research or (on rare occasions, as a supplement to research or in areas where research is scarce
because of the newness of the field), expert testimony.

In this class critical thinking skills and evaluation of evidence are elemental to good decision-making and the
success of the engagement. Find evidence. Use evidence. Cite evidence.

Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, please discuss
your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure
that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would
benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, contact them
at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Taking care of yourself
This is a stressful program, and a stressful time of your life. So your first job is to take care of yourself. Do your best
to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep (!)
and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us struggle from time to time and benefit from support during those times. Carnegie Mellon has many
helpful resources available on campus and an important part of your college experience is learning how to ask
for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is always helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, get help. Call Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) at 412-268-2922 or visit their website:
http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Reach out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting
connected to the support that can help.

If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or
night:
CaPS: 412-268-2922.

If the situation is life threatening, call the CMU Police at 412-268-2323; off campus call 911.

If you have questions about this or your coursework, please let me know.

Late or missed work
From time to time, extenuating circumstances may arise (a job interview, for example) that interfere with your
ability to make a presentation or complete an assignment as scheduled. While we obviously expect you to
schedule such events around class times, if you have no alternative but to miss a class you must alert your
team, the professor, and the TA as soon as you are aware of the need (so, before your absence) and we will try
to find an alternate time or solution. Failure to inform the professor or TA before your absence will result in a
reduced grade.

Professionalism
We expect that you will conduct yourselves as professional consultants in the real world. That means that you
are on time for class and meetings, that you behave in a professional manner with clients, and that you take
your responsibilities to the class, your team, and your client seriously. Failure to do so will result in a reduced
grade.

### Grading Rubric:

These criteria tell you what we expect of you, and what the organizations that are going to hire you expect of
you. They are also representative of current best business practices and what is expected in general
management roles.
### For your Mid-term and Final presentations, we’ll assess and evaluate (on a 1-5 scale) the following:

Analysis of the issue: How well are you identifying the problem behind the problem?

Strategy for solution: How effective is your approach to getting the information that you need?

Stakeholder identification & buy-in strategy: Have you identified all relevant stakeholders and gotten them “on
board?”
Methodology for your solution: How have you tailored your methodology to create an effective solution?

Quality of the solution: What evidence supports your solution?

Risk Mitigation: Have you effectively identified risks & articulated a mitigation strategy for each?

Professionalism: Are you conducting yourselves as real consultants with the client & with each other? Do you
work as an effective team?

Presentation Structure: Are your presentations appropriate to the audience & to this point in the engagement?

Are they easy to follow?
94803/94403 ConsultingLab | Spring, 2025 Professor Chris Labash
Course outline, syllabus, and schedule
Presentation Content & Visual Quality: Do your presentations feature high-value, informative content, and are
they well-produced, evidence-based, well-cited, and supported with effective visuals?

Presentation Delivery: (for all members) Is your appearance & manner professional? Do you project authority &
expertise? Are you relaxed & engaged, conversational & action-oriented? Do you address questions
effectively?

Notetaking.
### Good notetaking is essential to success in this course. Let me say that again in bigger type:

Good notetaking is essential to success in this course.

In real-world consulting you don’t get
handouts or readings. If your note-taking skills could be improved, check out the Cornell Note Taking System:
http://lsc.cornell.edu/study-skills/cornell-note-taking-system/. Or see your TA or me.
