### Course Information:

Class Time: See the course schedule at the end of the syllabus
Virtual Classroom hosted on Canvas (asynch) and Zoom (synch)
### Course Prerequisites:

Students should have taken courses that cover both information technology (Core IT
Design/Development/Management/Analytics, etc.) and business/managerial topics (Financial
management, business analytics, economic analysis, etc.). Students are highly recommended to
come from a CS/IS/IT background.
### Course Description:

The information age is continually transforming human interactions through an ever-changing
landscape of trending social and economic decision making. Information technology managers,
directors, and CIO/CTO's, once looked upon as the enablers of integrating and maintaining the
efficiency of business technologies, are now being utilized as more of the driving force behind
creating and sustaining competitive advantage over company rivals through technological
innovations and implementations. Commerce has metamorphosed and is continually being
transformed by these deviations to the norm, leading to new markets and potential business
opportunities.

To realize success in making critical business decisions, the IT leader must have a grounded
understanding of the technology in use, potentials for new technology, and the ability to
strategize and understand the impacts of incorporating technology in the business or industry
they serve, both nationally and globally. Likewise, the IT leader must also show precise focus to
the application of establishing a systematic path that encourages interactions between digital and
physical markets.

In this class, the focal point will hone in on two main areas: managing the business side of the
entity including its people and processes through established theoretical frameworks, and
managing the technical roles, innovations and implications for the digital business. From a
business context, the course will focus on digital business models including internet retail
(eCommerce marketplaces, subscription services, curated commerce, brick & mortar
establishments entering into fully autonomous commerce, how big data improves marketing
potential, showrooming, etc.), requirements elicitation for understanding and establishing the
needs of stakeholders both internal (employees) and external (consumers, suppliers, etc.),
understanding the roles of fulfillment in the current business environment, the difference
between SCM and ERP systems to determine advantages and disadvantages of each as well as
market development impacts, and understanding the workings of B2B and P2P markets. From a
technical context, this course will focus on current and emerging immersive technologies such as
IoT, ePayment, IA, Blockchain, Cloud-enabled tech (Meta/Spatial Computing) & Quantum
Computing.

Additionally, this course will examine IT related changes in the current marketspace through the
growth of internet and mobile commerce, social networking effects on markets, Web 2.0 (and
transitions into 3 and 4.0) including recommender systems and user generated/created content
(UGC/UCC) and understanding the differences and nuances of digital products and services.

Promoting an emphasis of the potential and proper implementation of these innovations through
analysis, strategy and design, and additionally the impacts of these innovations on the
organization will leverage a successful framework for maturing the digital business.

The project analyses will require students to engage in both technical and managerial problem
solving. The technical component of the analysis requires students to propose IT architectures for
the problems highlighted in the project. The managerial component of the analysis requires
students to analyze the business value of the proposed solution and address the change
management issues that arise in implementing any digital transformation initiative.
### High-Level Learning Objectives and Outcomes:

### Skills and knowledge the students are to gain and how they will be assessed include:

-Interpret, analyze, and apply technical and managerial components of emergent technologies
including digital business modeling, Internet of Things, ePayment technologies, robotic process
automation, blockchain technologies, and cloud and quantum computing drivers.
-Identify and examine key technological challenges and rewards from systems innovations, firstmover advantages and disadvantages, and the potential disruptions or opportunities to culture,
cross-industry collaborations, design thinking, and trust.
-Examine current and future trends surrounding the digitization of everything across sample
industries, businesses, and applicable contexts.
-Understand and adapt to the changing landscapes of economics from traditional physical to
evolving digital channels.

### Reading Materials:

Supplemental readings are available on Canvas or will be distributed in class. There is no
textbook requirement.

A “digital” reading packet containing cases and readings pertaining to lectures and assignments
will be posted during the sequence of the course and may or may not contain cases requiring
purchasing from HBP.
### Attendance Policy:

Students are expected to attend all scheduled mandatory class times. As most classes involve
team-based work including live presentations, it is imperative that students are a part of each
discussion. Any meeting not deemed as mandatory are optional attendance.
### Cheating, Plagiarism, and Academic Integrity:

Students at CMU are engaged in preparation for professional activity of the highest standards.

Each profession constrains its members with both ethical responsibilities and disciplinary limits.

To assure the validity of the learning experience Carnegie Mellon establishes clear standards for
student work. You are required to be familiar with all university policies on this subject (see
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html). An extract of
these policies is reproduced here:
In any presentation, creative, artistic, or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each
student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is
dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to
disciplinary action.
### Cheating includes but is not necessarily limited to:

Plagiarism, explained below.
o
Submission of work that is not the student's own for papers, assignments or
o
exams.

Submission or use of falsified data.
o
Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam or quiz.
o
Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination.
o
Use of unauthorized material including textbooks, notes or computer programs in
o
the preparation of an assignment or during an examination.

Supplying or communicating in any way unauthorized information to another
o
student for the preparation of an assignment or during an examination.

Collaboration in the preparation of an assignment. Unless specifically permitted
o
or required by the instructor, collaboration will usually be viewed by the
university as cheating. Each student, therefore, is responsible for understanding
# 95-734 — Managing Digital Business Syllabus, Fall 2024 Version: 4/11/2024

# 95-734 — Managing Digital Business Syllabus Page 4 of 14

the policies of the department offering any course as they refer to the amount of
help and collaboration permitted in preparation of assignments.

Submission of the same work for credit in two courses without obtaining the
o
permission of the instructors beforehand.

Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, failure to indicate the source with
quotation marks or footnotes where appropriate if any of the following are
reproduced in the work submitted by a student:
A phrase, written or musical.
o
A graphic element.
o
A proof.
o
Specific language.
o
An idea derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another person.
o
Regarding plagiarism, you should also familiarize yourself with the content of the separate
handout entitled “A Note on Plagiarism and Citing Sources.”
One application of this plagiarism policy for our class is that you may not provide or receive
information on project write-ups or class discussions from students outside of your section. This
includes both students from prior semesters and students from other sections in this semester.
### A Note Regarding Case “Solutions” on the Web:

There is a potential for the course to use predesigned cases to help guide the learning process.

Because these cases are used at a variety of schools, there may be slides and other materials
available for them on the web. I am asking you not to use these materials for the following
reasons:
## 1. Presumably you are here to learn how to best design, implement, and manage corporate IT

systems. The best way to do that is to struggle with these issues yourself and with your
teammates and classmates. Anything less and you are wasting your time and money as a student
and short-changing your long-term growth as an IT professional. Making (and learning from)
mistakes today is a very low-cost way to improve your skills. Once you hit the corporate world,
the mistakes become very costly.
## 2. Case analysis is not like algebra where there is an answer that the grader is looking for. These

cases are typically written with multiple possible recommendations. Don't assume that just
because someone in some business school says you should do X, that X is the “correct” way (or
even a good way) to approach a case.
## 3. You run the risk that others in the class will come across the same materials, make the same

recommendation as you (possibly using very similar words) — which raises huge red flags
regarding plagiarism.
## 4. It damages our classroom discussion. If everyone gives the same recommendation, we don't

# 95-734 — Managing Digital Business Syllabus, Fall 2024 Version: 4/11/2024

# 95-734 — Managing Digital Business Syllabus Page 5 of 14

have the opportunity to fully explore other options — and exploring and learning from other
options is part of the joy and excitement of case work.
## 5. It makes you subservient to the recommendations of others — who may or may not know

anything about the underlying technology, IT project management, etc. One of the premises of
the MISM/MSIT program is that people with a strong IT background will be able to do a better
job managing IT projects than others who don't have a tech background. I'm assuming that's why
you are here and not somewhere else.

So, for the sake of your professional development, our classroom discussion, your academic
integrity, and your pride in your degree program, using someone else's case “solutions” is a bad
idea. However, if you insist on using these resources, you must cite your sources in the body of
your report and on your slides, whether you use direct quotes from them or not. You are, of
course, perfectly free (and encouraged) to research any of the companies or issues that we
discuss in class. I am just asking that you not use outside discussions of the cases themselves.

Use of Generative AI (ChatGPT)
I expect you will use AI (e.g., ChatGPT and image generation tools) in this class. In fact, some
assignments require it. Learning to use AI is an emerging skill and to get started, I have provided
three tutorials below:
### *  How to use ChatGPT to boost your writing

### *  The practical guide to using AI to do stuff

### *  APA citation guidelines for GAI (ChatGPT example)

### You should also be aware of the limits of ChatGPT:

*  If you provide minimum-effort prompts, you will get low-quality results. You will
need to refine your prompts in order to get good outcomes. This will take work.
*  Don’t trust everything it says. If it gives you a number or fact, assume it’s wrong unless
you either know the answer or can check with another source. You will be responsible for
any errors or omissions provided by the tool. It works best for topics you understand.
*  AI is a tool, but one that you need to acknowledge using. Please include a paragraph at
the end of any assignment that uses AI explaining what you used the AI for and what
prompts you used to get the results. Failure to do so can constitute as an academic
integrity violation.
*  Be thoughtful about when this tool is useful. Don’t use it if it isn’t appropriate for the
case or circumstance.
### Resources we may use to validate work against generative AI (and that you can use) include:

https://aiwritingcheck.org/
# 95-734 — Managing Digital Business Syllabus, Fall 2024 Version: 4/11/2024

https://www.turnitin.com/ (built into Canvas)
https://github.com/jwkirchenbauer/lm-watermarking
https://gptzero.me/
### Some CMU strategies being employed include:

https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/technology/aitools/index.html
### You may use generative AI for the following work:

### *  Group & individual assignments

### You may NOT use generative AI for the following work:

### *  Surveys & the final exam

I am happy to meet and help you with these tools during office hours or after class.

Course Web Site: http://canvas.cmu.edu
We will use the Canvas site for course information and announcements. If you are registered in
the class, you should already have access. Your login id is your andrew id and password.

If you are on the wait list, you should still be able to access the site with your Andrew login
(apart from the student’s resources section). If this does not work, please e-mail any of us to
obtain temporary access.

The web site has an up-to-date copy of the syllabus, schedule, pertinent documentation, A/V, and
any class announcements. While I will try to make announcements both in class and on the web
site, it is a good idea for you to check the web site regularly. Additionally, the web site has links
to class readings and relevant sites mentioned in class and more extensive background material.
### Grading and Course Requirements:

You will be evaluated based on your project analyses, participation in discussions, project
presentations, and an individual final assessment handed out at the end of the mini. Your project
analyses will be graded as group work. Your grades for the final assessment and discussion
forum participation will be your own.

The final grade for the course is distributed among various assignments and activities posted
below. Canvas should only be used to track individual grades, not cumulative. The grading
system on Canvas does not accurately track the grading scheme used in this class. Please follow
up with the TA and/or myself for grading questions. The breakdown for your work is as follows:
### Consultant Tasks: Total # of Tasks Earning Potential

(Profile + E0) + Surveys 5 60.00
Individual Contributions 3*4 240.00
Written\Presented Projects 4 500.00
# 95-734 — Managing Digital Business Syllabus, Fall 2024 Version: 4/11/2024

# 95-734 — Managing Digital Business Syllabus Page 7 of 14

Final Assessment 1 200.00
18 1,000.00
Profile + E0 + Surveys: To start the course we will introduce ourselves and part of this will
require completion of Exercise 0 that is detailed in the introduction. Throughout the duration of
the course you will be tasked with completing assigned surveys which are autograded
Individual Contributions: Consists of three metrics:
## 1. Peer Review: Since the projects analyses and position papers are group work, I will

use a peer review instrument to ensure that feedback from group members about team
member contributions are considered in the determination of the final grade. 50% of the
peer evaluation is dependent on your timely and well-documented submission, with the
other 50% dependent on the scoring from your peers.
## 2. Individual Team Presentation Evaluation: Non-presenting teams are asked to fill out

a ranking survey and provide constructive comments for the two team presentations
reviewed.
## 3. Class Participation: This metric includes attending all required classes and providing

at least 1 comment and/or question during the live class, or after in the canvas
discussion area.

Project Analysis: You project analysis grade is based on a write-up (1 to 1.5-spacing, 12-point
Time New Roman font, 1-inch margins, and no more than 20 pages total (including cover,
summary, appendices, etc.) or a 20-minute presentation (PDF or PPT, 20 minutes maximum).

See the course schedule for due dates.

I will assign groups to either write their analysis or present their recommendations to class.

Your write-up and presentation should address the issues raised in the project narrative and
associated discussion questions. However, you are encouraged to go beyond the set of questions
that I give you to seed the discussion and to use additional resources to research the background
of the industries and correlated emergent technologies as you see fit. Project analysis documents
are group work and should adopt, but not be limited to the following perspectives:
a. What are the business/strategic drivers of process digitization in the particular business
and industry environments, coupled with the digital component being analyzed?
b. What is the role of IT architecture in either enabling or inhibiting process digitization?

How can the proposed emergent technology enhance or inhibit growth?
c. Given your knowledge of technologies to date, do you agree with the choice of
technologies for IT and/or for process change in the proposed areas?
d. Did the project describe the organizational challenges encountered in process
digitization? How do you suggest handling the organizational challenges? If the project
did not describe organizational challenges, what do anticipate them to be and what are
# 95-734 — Managing Digital Business Syllabus, Fall 2024 Version: 4/11/2024

# 95-734 — Managing Digital Business Syllabus Page 8 of 14

your recommendations for overcoming them?
e. What are the alternatives to the proposed technology and would you consider an
incumbent alternative over an emergent technology?

Detailed learning objectives and outcomes are provided for each section of the course in the
“Guide Sheet” document provided. Use these coupled with the above perspectives as a driver for
what to address in your solutions.

The format for the project write-up is contained in a handout that will be provided in class. For
the presentations, you should target 20 minutes of presentation time, but with enough backup
slides/information to answer any questions that might arise about your recommendations in a
Q&A session following the presentation.

Final Assessment: There will be a take home final assessment handed out in the last weeks of
class & is due finals week. The assessment will ask you to integrate information we have learned
across the projects, required readings and lectures we’ve covered in the semester.
### A Note on Regrade Requests:

We make every effort to return graded assignments within 1 week of their submission. If you
believe that your grade is inaccurate, you may request a regrade under the following conditions:
## 1. Regrade requests must be submitted within 1-week of the date when a grade was returned

# 95-734 — Managing Digital Business Syllabus, Fall 2024 Version: 4/11/2024

# 95-734 — Managing Digital Business Syllabus Page 11 of 14

## 2. Regrade requests must be in writing and must include a copy of the original assignment.

## 3. Regrade requests must outline the reasons you deserve a higher grade. These will

typically be that the grader misread or misunderstood your answer or didn’t take
something into account that they should have. For this, you should use the written
comments on the assignment as your reference point. Referencing another student’s grade
is inappropriate and irrelevant. While we do our best to apply an even standard across
students, we can’t discuss anyone else’s grade with you, so we need to deal with the
merits of your case.
## 4. I reserve the right to regrade the entire assignment and thus your grade may go up, down,

or stay the same. This regrade is considered final.
## 5. Class participation grades are inherently subjective and not subject to a regrade request. I

will make notes on participation at the end of each class and assign grades at the end of
the semester based on these notes.
### Late Submission Policy:

All late assignments are subject to a grade penalty of 10% per day past the due date/time, with a
maximum of 4 days. Anything not submitted within 4 days past the due date will receive an
automatic 0. Teams and individual submissions are subject to the same policy. Any issue with
meeting a deadline must be cleared through the instructor and/or TA prior to the submission
date/time or will be subject to the penalty.
### Student Health and Wellness:

CMU and all classes, including this one, strive to accommodate students in all capacities by
creating a learning environment that considers the health and well-being of all students. A review
the university policies regarding health and wellness can be reviewed at:
https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/current-grad-students/health-and-wellness/index.html
Graduate student policies can be reviewed at: https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/index.html
### Covid-19 Policies:

Being identified as a close contact no longer requires isolation. Students should attend class in
person unless they have tested positive or are experiencing COVID symptoms. Those students
should self-isolate until receiving a negative COVID test and symptoms resolve. Students who
test positive should report their result through the online self-reporting tool and follow all
relevant guidance.

Students who need to miss class should email their professors, self-isolate until cleared by
Community Health and Well-Being, and wear a high-quality, well-fitting facial covering for 10
days after testing positive. If personal accommodations are needed, students should reach out to
the Office of Disability Resources.

### Diversity and Inclusion:

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this
course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity
that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to
present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and
appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you
personally or for other students or student groups. In addition, if any of our class meetings
conflict with your religious events, please let me know so we can make arrangements for you.

The topics that we’re covering in this class can be difficult, not just intellectually but
emotionally. While I expect there to be rigorous discussion and even disagreement during our
class discussions, I ask that you engage in discussion with care and empathy for the other
members in the classroom. Aim to disagree without becoming disagreeable. In this class we will
not shy away from the uncomfortable. Critically examining and assessing our most basic
assumptions and values is not just one of the tasks of philosophy but is an activity vital to living
an authentic life. I urge you to have the courage to the uncomfortable in this class. In exchange
for your courage, I will work to ensure a classroom environment that supports your taking these
intellectual and emotional risks.
### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office,
I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as
possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you
suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet
registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at
access@andrew.cmu.edu.
### Student Academic Success Center (SASC):

SASC focuses on creating spaces for students to engage in their coursework and approach
