# COURSE DESCRIPTION

Communication in written form is an essential element of being a public policy professional. Writing for consulting
firms, government agencies, think tanks, advocacy groups, industry associations, and other contexts in the sphere of
public policy differs from academic writing. Accordingly, this course challenges students to convey critical thinking by
anticipating the perspectives of stakeholders in the practice of shaping public policy. The writing skills integral to this
process include: developing essential and persuasive content, communicating complex ideas, organizing information,
targeting diverse audiences with varying levels of expertise and roles, ensuring clarity, controlling tone, and designing
a document for readability. Students craft policy one-pagers as well as policy memos. Writing guidance and sample

### TEACHIN G ASSISTANT’S ROLE

Students who are seeking individualized help with writing can request appointments with the Teaching Assistant
(TA). The TA’s contact information is posted on Canvas > Announcements. Please contact the TA at least 2 business
days in advance. After scheduling an appointment, come prepared to ask a particular question about the assignment
or about a specific writing skill. Do not ask the TA to read and edit your entire draft. Instead, think of the TA as a
professional coach; the role is intended to provide guidance on the writing process and offer resources for you to
improve your work – ultimately, you are responsible for the work you submit.
# WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS

Instructions for written assignments will be posted to Canvas > Assignments. According to the schedule of classes
(see Table 2), on the draft and final due date for each assignment upload the document – before the time your
sEcVhAeLdUuAleTdI OseNc tion begins – to the Assignments area of Canvas using: lastname_firstname_section_assignment.pdf.

### G rades are non-negotiable (see Table 1). The semester grade will be based on the following:

 Class participation/exercises (10%)
 Quiz (20%)
Policy One-Pager (30%)
Op-Ed (40%)
The Heinz College writing rubric is included in this syllabus. Assignment-specific checklists for peer review and selfePdUiRtiPnOgS wEi All NbDe pAoSsStEeSdS tMoE CNaTn vOaFs D>R MAoFdTuSles > Editing Checklists.

Drafts serve as preparation for meetings with the TA and for peer-feedback sessions prior to submitting the final,
graded version. Further, drafts are useful for time management. Grade deductions will occur if a draft is incomplete, or
if there is a lack of participation in the peer-feedbac k sessions. Drafts submitted past the due date and time result in a
one-letter grade deduction from the final version of that assignment. Incomplete drafts result in half a letter grade
dPeOdLuICcYti oOnN o EffX tThEeN fSinIOalN vSe rsion for that assignment.

Late assignments earn a failing grade unless: (1) a religious observance or a medical condition prevents on-time
submission; and, (2) the student consulted with the instructor in advance, when possible, for approval of an alternate
dPuOeL IdCaYt eO. N STUDENT ACCOMMODATIONS
The Carnegie Mellon University Office of Disability Resources reviews requests for “reasonable accommodations,
academic adjustments, and auxiliary aids and services.” Students can work with the instructor to arrange
aAcCcAoDmEmMoICd aCtOioNnDs UaCs Tn eeded once accommodations are granted by the Office of Disability Resources.

Assignments are reviewed by Turnitin. This technology compares documents with content available on the Internet and
with files previously uploaded. The site generates a report indicating matching content. If an academic integrity
v iolation is suspected, the student will be contacted to meet with the instructor to determine if a violation has occurred
b ased on Carnegie Mellon University’s Policy on Academic Integrity. Note that academic integrity violations include:
 Presenting another writer’s work as your own;
Cutting and pasting content verbatim without using quotation marks to indicate a direct quote;
Inserting a direct quote or paraphrasing content without citing the source in-text using footnotes, endnotes, or
p arenthetical citations with a corresponding References, or Notes page – in a manner consistent with an APA or Chicago
st yle guide;
 Providing incomplete or incorrect information about the source cited;
Over-relying on templates or another writer’s phrasing;
Using content generated by AI platforms unless required by the instructor for a specific exercise.

Plagiarism is a serious offense that will result in the student failing the course. All academic integrity violations
will be reported to the associate dean's office for the student’s program of study and the Carnegie Mellon
University Division of Student Affairs. Additional penalties may be imposed.

# GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF AI

This course will provide you with an opportunity to explore generative AI for professional writing. We will
consider how AI platforms can be used to craft documents and to better understand the benefits and limitations of
generative AI.

Please note that the direct use of AI platforms, such as CoPilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT, is optional.
