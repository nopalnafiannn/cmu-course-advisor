### Master of Entertainment Industry Management

Course What Makes us Play: The Craft of the Video Game
Information Course Number: 93-860 Semester Credit Hours: 4, Class Meetings, 4
Instructor: Cheryl Platz <cheryl@ideaplatz.com>
Description Games have existed for almost as long as humans have walked the earth, but the video gaming
industry has emerged as an economic powerhouse in recent decades. The ability to create and
manipulate digital worlds completely … well, changed the game. But what differentiates a successful
game from a failure? What draws people to games, and what keeps people coming back? In this short
class, students will explore the basics of game design and learn how today’s most successful game
developers connect a solid game design with the realities of game development in order to captivate
and entertain players. This course touches on a wide variety of topics drawn from cognitive
psychology, human-computer interaction, visual design, storytelling, software engineering,
marketing, and the business world to paint a broad picture of the art and craft of gaming, giving
students the basic ability to understand what conditions are necessary for a great game to thrive.

Expectations Should you have any problems, please contact me prior to class.

Respect & Safety
The games industry is a wide space, but it can sometimes elicit strong or controversial opinions.

Students must always treat each other with respect and approach this space as a space of learning.

When engaging in gaming for class or recreation, please be safe & remember that players on the
other side are humans. In no way do we condone any “experimentation” with first-person toxic
behavior. University policies should be followed at all times, even when gaming for academic
research.

some time preparing your essay and deck.
### - Part 1 of 3: Game Basics

What game did you choose, and how is it positioned as a game?
o
Single or multiplayer? Live service game? Who is the publisher,
who is the developer (if separate), and when was the game
published? What platforms does it support?
### - Part 2 of 3: Game Loop

Name the top 1-2 motivators of play that are present? How do
o
they impact the core game loop?

What is your favorite part of this game? What makes you feel the
o
best when playing?

Bonus: Identify one thing the game could do better in your
o
opinion.

### - Part 3 of 3: Monetization

How does this game make money from players? How does the
o
spending of money impact the game loop, if at all? Do you feel
that you got good value for your money?

Evaluation Each student submission (written work and 5-minute presentation) will be
evaluated on the following:
### - Game Basics: (15%) Does the presentation reasonably identify this

specific game’s positioning in the market based on conditions we’ve
discussed?
### - Game Loop: (35%) Does the presentation reasonably identify one or

more core motivators of play that drive this specific game?
### - Monetization: (25%) Does this presentation reasonably identify one or

more ways in which the business model impacts the gameplay
experience?
### - Personal perspective: (25%) Does the presentation reasonably reflect the

student’s personal perspective based on hands-on gameplay as opposed
to an AI powered or repurposed review analysis?

at the human-computer interaction side of the equation necessary for success.

Class Class participation (which includes your General Attitude, Communication Skills, Organizational Skills
Participation and Creativity and Innovativeness) is important in this class because in the real world there are many
Rubric group dynamics and meetings that will require your input in the room and on your feet—as a writer,
producer, agent or executive. The industry is a collaborative medium and in order to be successful you
will need to have the ability to think on your feet, present your ideas articulately and succinctly and
contribute to group brainstorming sessions. You will also need to give and receive critiques with
diplomacy and grace. Our assessment of you will reflect all of these aspects of participation in addition to
professional presentation, enthusiasm, improvement throughout the course and punctuality.

### Topic Game Design Essentials

Abstract What is fun, anyway? We look at some of the most well-respected takes on what
makes games worth playing. What game design principles cut across all genres? How
do game designers evaluate what fun looks like? How does the human brain influence
how we perceive fun in a game? And how do we craft convincing worlds in which
players can play?

Class 2: TBD Saturday March/April 2025
Topic Living Games, from single player to live service
Abstract So you have a great game loop. Now what? How do you BUILD it, and how do you
keep it fun and engaging once you’ve released it to players? Games are no longer a
single CD-ROM burned into time – the advent of the Internet decades ago has created a
new reality where games must adapt in real time with the needs of the audience – and
the technology. But does every game need to be a live service game… and what about
all these layoffs? We will explore the basic realities of game development and
monetization and how they impact today’s game design decisions.

Topic Social Gaming: Creating community at scale
Abstract Many games in this generation have some form of multiplayer element, and it almost
seems to be a requirement for AAA titles. Why is that? What separates a good
multiplayer experience from a bad one? Creating a thriving multiplayer experience is
far more than just adding another player to the game – it requires an understanding of
how humans engage as a collective.

### Topic Multi-Platform Experiences: Expanding Markets and Mindshare

Abstract The consequence of success on a single platform is usually pressure to release on a
second platform. This is usually easier said than done unless you’re approaching
your work with a multi-platform mindset from the beginning. We take a look at the
current players in the hardware and software landscape in gaming, and how these
can influence your game design choices. What are the popular game engines, and
how do they make it easy or hard to develop on different platforms? What are the
major gaming marketplaces and how do they influence player behavior? And how
do you decide when a new technology like VR or a new console is appropriate?

Plagiarism Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely serious matters.
and cheating Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious
notice* violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or as
cheating on an examination, including take‐home as well as in class examinations. The punishment
for such offenses can involve expulsion from the MEIM Program and Heinz School.
### Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

### - Plagiarism (explained below)

### - Submission of work that is not the student’s own

### - Submission or use of falsified data

### - Unauthorized access to an exam or assignment

### - Use of a stand‐in for an exam

### - Use of unauthorized material in the preparation of an assignment or during an examination

### - Supplying or communicating unauthorized information to another student for use in an

- assignment or exam
- Unauthorized collaboration on an assignment. Collaboration must be explicitly permitted by
an instructor for it to be considered authorized.
### - Submission of the same work for credit in more than one course

- Plagiarism is the failure to indicate the source of work either with quotation marks or footnotes.
### - The source can be a phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific language, or an idea derived from

- the work of another person. Note that material on the web is another person’s work and is therefore
equally subject to the rules on plagiarism and cheating as any other source material.

Cheating and/or plagiarism on an assignment will result in a failing grade (0 points) for that
assignment. The assignment in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the offending
student’s assignments included
in grade calculations; thepoints for that essay zero (0) will be factored into the grade.

Furthermore, the cheating student’s final grade will be reduced one full letter grade. A cheating student’s fi
nal grade will be impacted significantly. In addition, cases of cheating and plagiarism will be submitted to a
nd reviewed by the Dean’s Office; more severe penalties may be imposed, up to and
including expulsion from the Heinz School.

Academic Dishonesty: Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards inside and outside
the classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e. plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration) is
obviously discouraged and will be treated appropriately. The usual penalty for violations is a failing grade
for the particular assignment in question; however, in some instances, such actions may result in a failing
grade for the course.

Artificial In this class, use of AI will be limited, as it is important to experience some gameplay viscerally to fully
Intelligence understand the impact of the game mechanics and the cognitive psychology behind fun, even if you do not
Policy: plan on becoming a gamer yourself.

You can use ChatGPT and other LLMs to help you learn and explore the vast space of gaming – but you
may not use these tools to copy and paste or generate first order analysis that you submit as your
work. In order to develop the “muscle” of game design, you must play and experience these games
firsthand.

For case studies, you may not use AI to generate analysis or critique – it must be based on your direct
gameplay experience, or firsthand research performed by you. Screenshots or snapshots of your gameplay

experience are encouraged, as well as firsthand insights like how you did in a round or what characters
you played to help bring the experience to life.

When preparing your final presentation, you may use DALL-E or other generative image AI to produce
clip art, but you must always cite when AI is used to generate content of any kind in your assignments.
### In general, you may not use AI to:

● Generate content that you cut and paste into an assignment with a written component without
quotations and a citation
● Generate content that is not paraphrased without a citation
● Generate bibliographies for topics that you haven’t researched yourself
● Generate other content (images, video, others) unless expressly permitted and following provided
guidance.
● Otherwise use or present generative AI content that you pass off as your own work, when really it
is not
### If you use AI:

● You must acknowledge the use of AI tools within your work.(APA allows you to cite AI)
● You should recognize that large language models often provide incorrect information, fake
citations, contradictory statements or incorporate plagiarized materials
