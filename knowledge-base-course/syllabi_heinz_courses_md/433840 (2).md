Course Management
All course materials will be managed through Canvas. Canvas will be used to post announcements of
assignments and other information. Please be sure to check these announcements frequently to ensure you have
the latest information about the course.

Textbook: None. Readings may be posted on Canvas on a week-by-week basis.

Prerequisites and Requirements
Students will be required to have a basic understanding of networking concepts (TCP/IP, OSI Model, etc.) and
know common Windows and Linux commands and functionality. This is a graduate-level course and students
will be expected to put in the additional time to research solutions on their own and learn any prerequisite
skills they do not currently possess.

Course Description
The course takes a hands-on approach to introduce students to the different network defenses that exist to block,
mitigate, and detect cyber-attacks. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and network sniffers are just
some of the tools that students will learn to deploy and configure in a live lab environment. Additionally, time
will be spent learning how to analyze data to make conclusions about the network that is being monitored and
actively attacked.

Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this course, the student will obtain an understanding and will apply key concepts,
including:
Learning Objective(s)
### * Basic network fundamentals – including topologies, protocols, and services, and security issues affecting

networks.
### * Identify technical components supporting network defense

### * Understand scenarios and use cases in which defense tactics may be applied

### * Become familiar with network defense protocols, tools, and tactics required in modern computer

networks
### * Demonstrate how network defenses are applied according to policy requirements

### * Foundational concepts of cyber and information security and the key practices and processes for

### * Basic network fundamentals – including topologies, protocols, and services, and security issues affecting

networks.
### * Identify technical components supporting network defense

### * Understand scenarios and use cases in which defense tactics may be applied

### * Become familiar with network defense protocols, tools, and tactics required in modern computer

networks
Each learning objective will be assessed via feedback during lectures, assignments, discussions, presentations,
and examinations.

Evaluation Method
### The final grade is out of 400pts (100%). The grading breakdown is as follows:

Externally Written or Canvas Assignments (1) 20pts (5%)
Foundry/Crucible Graded Labs (10) 20pts each for a total of 200 (50%)
Quizzes (6) 10pts each for a total of 60 (15%)
Presentation/Participation (1) 20pts (5%)
Final Exam (1) 100pts (25%)
Grade Distribution
A+ 100% B+ 87 - 89% C+ 77 - 79%
A 93 - 99% B 83 - 86% C 73 - 76%
A- 90 - 92% B- 80 - 82% C- 70 - 72%
*A+ cannot be achieved by bonus points or curved grading
Grading Rubric/explanation of grades
Grading rubrics or scoring explanations will be developed to assess assignments. Rubrics will be made
available to students before each assignment is due.
### Quizzes:

A short quiz will be administered at the beginning of classes 2 through 7 consisting of multiple choice and fill-inthe-blank questions. These questions will be based on the previous class’ lecture and labs/assignments.
### Labs:

Labs will be modules within the Foundry/Crucible (alternatively STEPfwd) environment that will focus on
applying hands-on application to concepts learned in the lecture. Students will be required to complete each lab
and will be tracked within the environment. Each lab will have progress or knowledge-based assessments,
whereas completion and correctness will determine the final score. Labs may be available and may be
completed earlier than the week assigned, but must be completed no later than the start of the class following
their assignment.
### Assignments:

Assignments will take different forms depending on the subject. Some will be done on personal computers and
others may be submitted via Canvas. Each one will have explicit directions and guidance on the scoring which
will be based on a mix of completion and correctly answered questions.
### Research Presentation:

Students must gain skills and confidence in analyzing technical concepts and conveying them to others.

Students in this course will develop a presentation based on publicly available sources that will demonstrate
his/her ability to communicate technical constructs/challenges/issues clearly and effectively. Additional
information regarding this assignment will be provided in Canvas.
### Final Exam:

The final exam is delivered in Canvas and draws on the knowledge and concepts learned in the lectures, labs,
assignments, and group project. Questions may be specific to the content completed during the course, even
content that was not previously graded. The final exam will be open book and notes.

Late assignment policy
Any lab turned in late will face a 50% reduction for the first 24 hours that it is turned in late. After 24 hours
the assignment will receive a 0% grade. This policy will be STRICTLY enforced. I WILL NOT accept late
homework, including quizzes, unless the student has made arrangements with me prior to the assignment's
due date. PRIOR ARRANGEMENTS MUST BE MADE NO LATER THAN 12 PM ON THE DUE DATE.

Cheating and plagiarism
For all submissions for a grade, each student is responsible for handing in his/her own work. For any
assignment found to be the partial or complete result of cheating or plagiarism, penalties will be enforced
consistent with Carnegie Mellon University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions. Cheating is defined as
inappropriate collaboration among students on an assignment or exam or failure to cite the work of others. This
can include copying someone else’s work with or without alteration. When students are found to be
collaborating in this way, BOTH will pay the penalty regardless of who originated the work. Please refer to the

life/academic‐integrity.html https://www.cmu.edu/student‐affairs/theword/academic‐discipline/index.html
### Use of Generative AI:

You may use generative AI programs like ChatGPT during the brainstorming and idea-generation phase for
assignments, if applicable. However, doing so cannot be considered a substitute for traditional
research. Generative AI programs rely on predictive models to generate content that may appear correct, but
has been shown to sometimes be incomplete, inaccurate, taken without attribution from other sources, and/or
biased. Any information generated by an AI program should be cited like any other reference material. You are
ultimately responsible for the content of the information you submit. However, you may not attempt to pass off
any work generated by an AI program as your own. Passing off any generated content as your own (for example
- cutting and pasting content into written assignments, or paraphrasing AI content) constitutes an academic
integrity violation. If you have questions about using generative AI in this course, please talk to me.
### Take Care of Yourself

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol,
getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources
available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for
support sooner than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experience any academic stress, difficult life events, or feel anxiety or depression,
we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is available to help:
call 412.268.2922 and visit the website: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/ . Consider reaching out to a friend,
faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.
### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage
you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with
you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability
and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I
encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.
