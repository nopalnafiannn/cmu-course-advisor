Grading Summary
### Class Participation - 20%

### In Class Workshops - 25%

### Mini Cases - 30%

### Final Case Analysis - 25%

The TA’s and I will work quickly to return graded cases via Canvas. If you have a grading dispute, this
must be communicated within one week after receiving your grade. You will need to provide specific
details/questions on the dispute.

Class Participation
Class participation will be a portion of your grade. This will be a reflection of frequency of participation,
quality of your comments and listening attentively to your classmates. You have the opportunity to earn
full points if you attend class regularly, come prepared for class, participate in the case discussions and
not distracted by phones or other work during our class sessions. A rubric will be used at the end of the
course to determine participation points based on the factors mentioned above.

As an interactive class, you are expected to participate (e.g., engage with the professor and class
members during class). You may be awarded additional bonus points for extra effort. As a note, these
points are completely at the professor's discretion and based on direct observations during class and will
be assigned during final grading. No additional extra credit or bonus points is offered during the course.

Attendance is required for the course and this will go towards your participation grade. You may miss 2
classes for any reason. If you are going to miss class, especially a case discussion, you will still be
responsible for working through the in class workshop file. You may reach out to the professor or
classmates for help with completion.

In-Class Workshops
There will be a variety of cases utilized in the course during the in class discussions and workshops. It is
expected that you have read the associated cases prior to lecture as we will be going over them and
utilizing budgeting methods during class. During class we will complete various budgeting items in
Microsoft Excel. You are expected to complete the files during class and submit at the end of class in
Canvas. The workshop submission will be open until 11:59pm the same day as class. You will be graded
on completion of the file not accuracy for the in class workshops. Your lowest score will be dropped of
the 7 In Class Workshops, so if you miss a class this can be your dropped score.

Mini Cases
Mini cases will be assigned through the course. These will be utilized to apply concepts that were
implemented during lecture. You will need to write a brief summary of your analysis from the case
along with submitting the Microsoft Excel file associated with your analysis. The mini cases will be
evaluated for accuracy of the Microsoft Excel file, well-organized, easy to read, the analysis should be
well-written in complete sentences and using the appropriate terminology from class.

Mini cases turned in after the due date will be eligible for a maximum of 90% of the original grade. You
have a late grace period of 24 hours past the due date to turn in the mini case for the reduced grade.

Past the late grace period of 24 hours, they will not be accepted.

Final Case Analysis
Your overall understanding of the various budgeting and analytical methods of the course will be
assessed through a final case analysis due the last week of class. This will be a significant portion of your
grade so you should plan to devote sufficient time for completion. There will be both written and
Microsoft Excel portion of the final case analysis to highlight your understanding of the principles during
the course, completeness of answering the questions in the case and support for your
recommendations. Your Microsoft Excel files need to be neatly organized as if you are presenting this to
an Executive level director at an organization. No late assignments will be accepted unless prior
arrangements are made.

Academic Integrity
All mini cases and case analysis that you are submitting should be in your own words, not classmates
and not directly taken from online resources. You may work with classmates to discuss cases and ask
questions, but the cases are to be completed individually. I will be checking for plagiarism amongst case
submissions which includes having the same sentences as a classmate. Academic integrity violation will
not be tolerated and will be communicated to Your Program Director, The Associate Dean and The Dean
of Student Affairs at the University. If you are caught cheating, your final grade will be reduced by 2
letter grades.

You may use generative AI programs like ChatGPT during the class and/or cases to help you understand
course content but not to generate answers to case problems or for grammatical improvement to your
memos and analysis. Generative AI programs rely on predictive models to generate content that may
appear correct, but has been shown to sometimes be incomplete, inaccurate, taken without attribution
from other sources, and / or biased. You are ultimately responsible for the content of the information
you submit. However, you may not attempt to pass off any work generated by an AI program as your
own, you must cite any reference to AI during your coursework.

Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I
encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible.

I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you
may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office
of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Diversity
We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable
and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves,
including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation,
gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these
diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students,
faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion
not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We
acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our
classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core
values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They
contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university.

Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment
on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after
the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:
Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: reportit.net username: tartans password: plaid

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions.

Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus
climate to be more equitable and just.

Food Insecurity
If you are worried about affording food or feeling insecure about food, there are resources on campus
that can help. Email the CMU Food Pantry Coordinator to schedule an appointment:
