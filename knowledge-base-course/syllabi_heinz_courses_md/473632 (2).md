Description Artificial Intelligence or AI is the science of making machines smart. Generative Artificial Intelligence
is an AI system that responds to prompts to create new content including images, text, storytelling,
music, video, and film. Based on Natural Language Processing models and utilizing neural networks, it
can generate these different media formats by identifying patterns and structures within existing data. It
is a probabilistic tool. The use of such Large Language Models and machine learning techniques is a
game changer in the entertainment industry.

This course introduces the use of AI tools specific to the media business and an overview of related
moral complexities that you may face as a working professional in the entertainment industry. We will
examine the issues that often arise within an industry that places corporate profits and artistic freedom
above all else. Through practical application as well as class discussion, we will highlight how AI is
transforming the entertainment industry. In particular, the course will address how quickly AI is
disrupting traditional business models, intellectual property rights, and studio production as well as
creating tension between creative artists, executives, talent, trade unions, agencies, and audiences.

Suggested The following suggested films relate to the topic artificial intelligence in different ways. As this class only

### Course Policies & ABSENCES/ TARDY:

Expectations If you know you are going to be late or have to miss a class, please contact Kevin, Dan, or Mary prior to
class via email or leave a message for me at the MEIM Center.
### PARTICIPATION:

Class participation, which includes your General Attitude, Communication Skills, Organizational Skills
and Creativity and Innovativeness, is weighted heavily in this class
Plagiarism and Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely serious matters.
cheating notice Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious
violations.The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or as
cheating on an examination, including take‐home as well as in- class examinations.

The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the MEIM Program and Heinz School.
### Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

## 1. Plagiarism (explained below);

## 2. Submission of work that is not the student’s own;

## 3. Submission or use of falsified data;

## 4. Unauthorized access to an exam or assignment;

## 5. Use of a stand‐in for an exam;

## 6. Use of unauthorized material in the preparation of an assignment or during an examination;

## 7. Supplying or communicating unauthorized information to another student for use in an assignment or

exam;
8.Unauthorized collaboration on an assignment. Collaboration must be explicitly permitted by an instruct
or for it to be considered authorized;
## 9. Submission of the same work for credit in more than one course.

Plagiarism is the failure to indicate the source of work either with quotation marks or footnotes. The
source can be a phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific language, or an idea derived from the work
of another person. Note that material on the web is another person’s work and is therefore equally
subject to the rules on plagiarism and cheating as any other source material.

Cheating and/or plagiarism on an essay assignment will result in a failing grade (0 points) for that
assignment. The essay in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the offending
student’s assignments included in grade calculations; the points for that essay zero (0) will be factored
into the grade. Furthermore, the cheating student’s final grade will be reduced one full letter grade.

A cheating student’s final grade will be impacted significantly. In addition, cases of cheating and
plagiarism will be submitted to and reviewed by the Dean’s Office; more severe penalties may be impos
ed, up to and including expulsion from the Heinz School.

Academic Dishonesty: Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards inside and outside
the classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e. plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration) is
obviously discouraged and will be treated appropriately. The usual penalty for violations is a failing
grade for the particular assignment in question; however, in some instances, such actions may result in a
failing grade for the course.

Artificial In this class, you are welcome and encouraged to use generative AI programs such as ChatGPT,
Intelligence Policy Perplexity, or DALL-E.
### Suggested uses include:

*  Brainstorm new ideas.
*  Develop example outlines or approaches to your work.
### *  Creating loglines

*  Research topics or generate different ways to talk about a problem.
### If you use AI:

*  You must acknowledge the use of AI tools within your work.
### *  You should recognize that large language models often provide incorrect information, fake

citations, contradictory statements or incorporate plagiarized materials.
*  Tools like ChatGTP are not a verifiable of truth or fact.

### AI Warm-Up:

Assignment #1
Assignment Title
### Warm-Up AI Prompt Engineering Exercise

Due
In-class Exercise
Point of Concentration
The assignment will allow the student to explore how to best articulate prompts for generative AI
Assignment Focus/ Background
An AI Prompt is any form of text, question, information, or coding that communicates to AI what response you are looking for.

Adjusting how you phrase your prompt will vary the AI response. For this in-class assignment, you are to generate 3 distinct
creative outputs using AI-driven prompts demonstrating the versatility of AI in the creative process.

Prompts are best when they are specific. Avoid using vague prompts. Prompts are not necessarily the same as doing a
general internet query. Knowing how to write concise, clear prompts will ensure that any future command for AI will
help you receive specific, strong responses.

For example, there is no need to ask AI who the 10th President of the United States is. An internet question quickly gives
you about 197,000,000 results in 0.37 seconds.
### Internet response:

Who was the 10th President of the United States?
“John Tyler became the tenth President of the United States (1841-1845) when President William Henry
Harrison died in April 1841. He was the first Vice President to succeed to the Presidency after the death of his
predecessor.”

AI prompt
You are a college professor explaining to master level students who the 10th president of the US was and why this
person was important
“John Tyler held the presidency from 1841 to 1845 and played a significant role in shaping the country during a
critical period. Let's delve into his life and his contributions.

John Tyler's Background: John Tyler was born on March 29, 1790, in Charles City County, Virginia. He hailed from a
prominent Virginia family and received a solid education, which helped him excel in his political career. Before
becoming president, Tyler served as a U.S. Representative, a Virginia state legislator, and the Governor of Virginia.

Assuming the Presidency: Tyler's presidency was marked by a unique and complex set of circumstances. He became the
10th President in 1841 after the untimely death of President William Henry Harrison, making him the first Vice
President to ascend to the presidency due to the death of a sitting president. Tyler's assumption of office tested the limits
of the U.S. Constitution and established important precedents for presidential succession.
### Key Contributions:

## 1. Annexation of Texas: One of Tyler's major achievements was his role in the annexation of Texas to the United States in

## 1845. This was a significant expansion of U.S. territory, though it also intensified debates over the issue of slavery and

its extension into new states.
## 2. Webster-Ashburton Treaty: Tyler's administration negotiated the Webster-Ashburton Treaty in 1842, which settled

various border disputes between the United States and Great Britain, particularly along the northeastern border with
Canada. This treaty helped establish clearer boundaries and promote peaceful relations between the two nations.
## 3. Veto of National Bank: Tyler was known for his strong commitment to states' rights and his belief in a strict

interpretation of the Constitution. He famously vetoed attempts to recharter the Second Bank of the United States,
demonstrating his dedication to limiting federal power and influence.

Importance and Legacy: John Tyler's presidency is notable for the precedent he set in presidential succession, as well as
for his efforts to expand the nation's territory and assert states' rights. His presidency also reflected the intense debates
over issues such as slavery, economic policy, and the balance of power between the states and the federal government.

Tyler's firm stance on these issues and his determination to uphold his interpretation of the Constitution earned him both
supporters and critics. While his presidency was marked by challenges and controversies, his contributions to the nation's
growth and the evolution of presidential authority cannot be overlooked.

In conclusion, John Tyler's significance lies not only in his presidency itself but also in the lasting impact of his decisions
and beliefs on the trajectory of American history. His legacy continues to be a subject of study and discussion, offering
insights into the complexities of the early 19th century United States and its journey toward defining its national identity.
