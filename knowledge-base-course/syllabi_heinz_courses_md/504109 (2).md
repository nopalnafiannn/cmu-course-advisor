*  6% - Pre-class quizzes (12 quizzes, drop the lowest 2, 0.6% each)
Assignment *  4% - Unannounced quizzes (6 quizzes)
Weights *  30% - Projects (5 projects, 6% each)
*  10% - Lab Quizzes (11 labs, drop the lowest one, 1% each)
*  30% - Midterms (2 midterms, 15% each)
*  20% - Final exam
Project *  You have 7 grace days you can use to turn in projects late with no
Assignments penalty. Grace days may *only* be used for projects.
and Late *  This policy is meant to cover such issues as minor illness, job
Assignments interviews, travel, and so on.
*  Any portion of a day late (e.g. 1 second) counts as one grace day used.
### *  TAs will keep track of your late days, and after 7, a penalty of 10% per

day late will be applied.
### *  You should not contact the instructors nor TAs when you use your one

late allowance; it will be automatically applied.

*  A second late is late. Plan ahead so that you are not trying to submit
with 10 seconds to go, and find that the Canvas server clock is 11
seconds ahead of your laptop clock.

Labs *  Each student must be registered for and regularly attend a lab.
### *  Labs are primarily hands-on activities, where assistance from fellow

students and a TA is available.
### *  You are allowed to help other students and get help from other students

on labs (and labs only).
*  Each lab will have a Lab Quiz. The points you receive on this quiz
show that you’ve actually done the lab.
*  Each Lab Quiz should be completed as you work on the lab. The lab
write-up will contain markers to indicate that there’s a Lab Quiz
question related to the material.
### *  There will be questions on the exams that test for having completed and

understood the labs.
*  Late Lab Quizzes receive zero credit. There are no exceptions to this
policy. The lowest Lab Quiz grade is automatically dropped from the
final grade.

Weekly Quizzes For each lecture, there will be pre-class material to read or watch and a preclass quiz. This short quiz will be available only from 2:00 pm Friday until
2:00 pm Monday Pittsburgh time. No credit will be given for the quiz outside
this timeframe. There will be 12 quizzes, and the two lowest-scored quizzes
will be dropped and 10 will be counted in your final grade.

Policy on Collaboration is permitted in Labs but not on any other assignments.
collaboration
and cheating On projects, copying code without citing it is cheating. Copying code from a
fellow student is cheating.

You may choose to use a large language model to assist with your
programming work, unless it is otherwise prohibited – please read the
directions carefully. Note that LLMs often make mistakes. You are responsible
for any errors or problems that may be present in the code that you submit. The
closed book exams are designed to test your knowledge and coding skills. So, if
you do use a large language model, be sure to master the material and truly
understand the code before taking an exam.

However, your responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow
the academic integrity guidelines of the university and of this class. If you
use one of these generative AI tools to develop content for an assignment, you
are required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work, just as you should cite
code acquired from any other source.

If you copy code from the Web, be sure to provide a comment in the code with
the exact URL where the code was copied from. In practice, cutting and pasting
content from any source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing
content from a generative AI without citation is plagiarism. Similarly, using

any generative AI tool without appropriate acknowledgement will be treated as
plagiarism. The university’s policy on plagiarism applies to all uncited or
improperly cited use of work, whether that work is created by human beings
alone or in collaboration with a generative AI. Provide as a comment in the
code the exact URL where the code was copied from.

Code that is provided by the instructors is allowed as long as the code is clearly
cited as being provided by the instructors. Of course, if you have violated the
spirit of the project, you will earn zero points.

In addition to any penalties imposed by the instructor, all cheating and
plagiarism infractions will be reported in writing to the Associate Dean for the
program, the Associate Dean of Faculty, the Dean of Student Affairs, and the
Dean. They will review and determine if expulsion should be recommended.

The report will become part of the student’s record.

The appropriate people to refer to for help in homework projects are the TAs
and the instructors. They can look at your code and help you with it. See them
during office hours.
### Communication Given that:

Guidelines
### *  There are very many students in 95-702, so dealing with lots of

individual email doesn't scale. Use Piazza!
### *  Other students often have the same questions you do

### *  There are TA and instructor office hours

### Regarding Class Absences:

*  Don't send us email, we don't need to know.
*  You are responsible for the content.
*  Come to office hours if you have questions.
### Regarding Questions about Class Topics:

*  Ask in class. !!!
*  Use Piazza to post your question.
*  Come to office hours if you have follow-up questions.
### Regarding Homework Project Questions:

*  Ask in class. !!!
### *  Use Piazza to post questions

*  Go to TA office hours.
*  Go to faculty office hours if the TAs have not been able to help.
### Regarding Late Homework Project Submission:

### *  Read the policy on late submissions

o With so many students, they cannot change.

*  Do not email instructors nor TAs that your project will be late.
### *  If your assignment is late (even one minute late) the TAs will apply the

late allowance. Future late assignments will lose 10% per any part of a
day.
*  Plan ahead.
### Regarding What is On the Final Exam:

### *  Assume anything discussed in class or in lab or assigned as readings

might be on the final exam.
*  Ask specific questions about this material in class.
### *  Come to faculty office hours if you have specific questions

*  Don't ask "What is on the final exam?"
*  Don't ask "Will X be on the final exam?"
### Regarding Grading Complaints:

### *  See "Policy on complaints about grading" below

If you have a serious personal problem that impacts your ability to proceed
normally thorough the course, please don't hesitate to email or see the
instructors. Those we certainly do want to hear about and are happy to help
you with!

Role of TAs We hope and intend that the TAs will provide you with valuable assistance.
### *  TAs should:

o Be present for lab sessions and office hours.
o Be helping students during labs and office hours, not doing their
own work.
o Help you understand the project assignments and class topics
o Help you with general questions concerning your project
assignment code.
o Help you go over what your code should or should not be doing.
o Grade your projects within two weeks of submission
### *  TAs should not:

o Find your code bugs.
o Fix your code for you.
o Show you their version of the code.
### *  TAs are also very busy students, and cannot reply to your questions by

email, chat, phone, Facebook, Twitter, SMS, smoke signal, or telepathy.
o Except if they invite you to contact them.
o Don't abuse the offer.
### *  If you have complements or problems with the TAs assistance:

o The instructors definitely want to know about it.
o Please tell us about it before or after class, or during office
hours.
o Please do not send it in email, unless instructed by us.

Conflicts with *  Exams take precedence over job interviews and trips.
the Final Exam *  No allowances or rescheduling will be given for missing the final exam
because of a job interview, job trip, marriage, or good air fares.

Policy on *  TAs need to make distinctions between excellent, good, and bad work.
complaints about *  Grading mistakes may occur.
grading *  Please contact the TA who graded your assignment about grading
mistakes.
*  It will be up to the TA to handle the complaint.
### *  If you are still not satisfied with the TA's grade please contact your

instructor.
*  Our initial reaction will be to support the TA's grade.
### *  In some cases, however, we might agree with the student and ask for the

grade to be adjusted.
### *  Please make any grading concerns known to the TA immediately

(within 1 week).
*  Set up an appointment with the TA and get the matter resolved.

Project Grading *  A TA will normally be assigned to grade the projects.
### *  Given the number of students in the course, we will sometimes use the

common practice of selecting some sections of a code or project
reflections and grading that carefully and assigning the assignment
grade based on that segment(s).

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability
Resources office, we encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs
with either instructor as early in the semester as possible. We will work with
Accommodations you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect
that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are
not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we encourage you to
contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

We must treat every individual with respect.

We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and
maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer
to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race,
color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender
identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information.

Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here,
shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We,
at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because
diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue
justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the
work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a
campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.

or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for
Community
individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages
anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of
identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident
or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the
following resources:

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be
any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all
shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and
just.

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well,
exercising, avoiding recreational drugs and excessive alcohol, getting enough
sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and
cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone.

There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of
the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Ask for support sooner
rather than waiting.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life
events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to
