# COURSE PURPOSE

This course will introduce you to the basic concepts and tools of microeconomics and welfare
economics, which are used to analyze public policy from an economic perspective. We then will
review basic macroeconomic concepts and how they relate to public policy. We will use the
economic framework to explain:
1. the demand and supply components of markets;
2. when markets are efficient and equitable;
3. how government policy relates to market failure at the microeconomic level.

4. how government statistics relate to macroeconomics and subsequent policy.

The focus of the class will be on public policy and its relation to economics. In order to apply
economic concepts in a practical way, we will use current events as supplied by the textbook and
by additional readings. I hope to help you further develop your critical thinking skills by using
economic theory as a foundation for problem analysis. Examples of issues I hope to cover are:
-Is free trade a good thing?
-Is a minimum wage increase a good goal for society?
-How can the government reduce air and water pollution?
-Why does the government regulate some markets more than others?
-What is the official unemployment measure and is it relevant today?
-What are monetary policies to jump start a lagging economy?
-What are fiscal policies to jump start a lagging economy?
### LEARNING OBJECTIVES:

### The course has several goals in moving you forward in your learning experience:

## 1. Apply basic economic concepts to everyday life.

## 2. Using economics, discover a problem, analyze alternative solutions to the problem, and

form opinions as to which solution is best for society.
## 3. Improve your communication skills.

# COURSE READINGS

The required textbooks for the course are Principles of Economics by Robert Frank, Ben
Bernanke, Kate Antonovics, and Ori Heffetz, 2024 Edit. You can choose whether to purchase a
loose leaf copy or an e-copy. Additional handouts and readings will be provided.

Note: There are earlier editions and you are welcome to buy one (suggest 8th edition). I make
my own quizzes and homeworks and upload them to Canvas. However, you will not have access
to practice problems so if you have not had economics before, or if your algebra skills are rusty,
you may want to stick with the 2024 edition.
### EXPECTATIONS OF WORK LOAD:

You will have a lot of reading for the course and will be expected to come to class prepared. In
addition, economics uses graphs and equations to make points and develop concepts. If you are
unfamiliar with economics or algebra, you should plan to spend additional time working with me
or with the TA. The TA will review basic graphing and algebra concepts in the first review.
# ATTENDANCE POLICY

I understand that you are adult students, usually working, and you may need to miss a class due
to related obligations. Normally, I don’t give make-up inclass work, but if you let me know
ahead of time of your planned absence, I will make arrangements to help you finish the work.
# ASSESSMENT

Grading is comprised of several components: homeworks, tests, in class discussion, and one
project.
### Quizzes, Inclass Work 10%

Inclass Work 5%
Short Report 10%
Homeworks 15%
Midterm 25%
Final 25%
### Contribution to Class 10%

(Class participation or Discussion Board Participation)
Quizzes: I will require 5 quizzes throughout the semester. The quizzes will be on Canvas, under
Quizzes. I will not time the quiz, and you will also have the ability to retake the test if you didn’t
receive a score that you like.

Each quiz will be worth 5 points. Quizzes will be comprised of 4-6 questions, using multiple
choice or a problem or two to solve.

Inclass Work: In class assignments often involve solving problems in a group in breakout rooms,
and I will come around to help you. One person in the group should send me their answers via email to mb17@andrew.cmu.edu.

If you are missing a class and an inclass assignment will be given, you can answer the questions
related to that assignment prior to the start of class. Alternatively, since I drop the lowest score,
you can skip an inclass assignment if you are not attending. If you are in a group breakout room,
please turn on your video so that you can see one another.

Homeworks: There will be 5 take-home assignments throughout the term. You are permitted to
discuss the assignments with each other to develop approaches to solving the problems.

However, you must write your own answers to the problem sets, in your own words. Do not
simply copy someone else's answers. The assignments are designed to help you learn the
material discussed in class and to prepare you for the tests. Therefore, if two or more
homeworks look identical, those individuals will receive a 0 for that work. Or, if you happen to
find the answer key online and use those answers in a homework, you will receive a 0 for that
work.
### Special notes regarding homeworks:

## 1. Unless you received permission before a due date, assignments late within 24 hours

receive half of the points; assignments late beyond that will be checked but will not
receive a grade.
## 2. While you do not need to type answers (making graphs in WORD is not easy), I do

expect that you will hand in homeworks that took some thought and demonstrate your
professional attitude. I should be able to read your handwriting and graphs easily online.
## 3. Unless you receive prior permission, please do not send me a homework or paper via email. Upload them onto Canvas, so I can use Speedgrader.

Tests: The midterm and final will be comprised of essays and problem-solving questions. The
final is not comprehensive in the sense that I will ask questions that cover any topic from the
semester. However, the nature of teaching economics is comprehensive: we use supply and
demand curves throughout the course; the price elasticity of demand will pop up as we discuss
later issues, such as monopoly power; the key assumptions and concepts of rationality and
opportunity cost are used each week, at least implicitly; the key economic concepts presented by
the textbook authors are concepts I hope you remember a year from now.

Short Report: The short report will be a persuasive argument for or against an economic policy.

Details will be provided later.

Class Contribution: I expect you to come to class prepared to ask questions, discuss issues, and
challenge others (including me) on their statements. I will grade this portion of the final grade as
follows:
## 1. If someone never misses a class, but rarely speaks during discussion and never posts on

Canvas, that individual will receive at most 70% of the Class contribution portion of the
final grade.
## 2. Class discussion will be graded on the following components:

- Who was prepared to answer questions from the class?
- What type of discussion was developed by the individual? Were there only
clarifying questions? Opinions stated? Challenges made?
- How did the discussion tie in economics?
- How did individuals integrate previous discussion to the issue at hand?

Please note the attachment at the end of the syllabus on ideas about quality class
discussion.
## 3. During class discussion, you must turn on your video so that I can see you. If you fail to

turn on the video, you will not be scored for that particular discussion.

On occasion, I will use the discussion board on Canvas to continue a discussion from class or to
begin a new round of discussion. I will count, as part of the inclass grade, the quality of
comments in this discussion (so if you are on the shy side in class, please use this forum to
discuss issues).

Please note that CMU has strict guidelines regarding cheating and plagiarism, which range from
failing grades on assignments to dismissal from the program. You should review the
University’s rules regarding academic honesty. I ask that you do not place me in the position of
using these rules. https://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/

### Quality of Class Discussion

Students have correctly pointed out that teachers who evaluate class discussion have a responsibility to spell out
the criteria that will be used to assess the quality of student discussion. With full awareness that evaluation is
inescapably subjective, at least in large part, let me try to be responsive to that responsibility.
### Outstanding contributions to discussion will:

## 1. Display extensive preparation for the day’s class. This criterion is a foundation for the others set

below.
## 2. Demonstrate sensitivity to the need for logical flow in the class. Your comments and questions

should be linked explicitly to the direction in which the class has been headed. Resist the temptation
that we all feel to introduce a personal anecdote or perspective that just popped into our mind, but
that has no easily recognizable link to the ongoing discussion in our class.
## 3. Reveal an awareness of the importance of a critical spirit. To make this point more directly, you

should demonstrate an eagerness and ability to critically evaluate the reading assignment, the claims
of other students, and what is especially meritorious, the reasoning of the professor. The aim here is
not for your to be a wiseacre, annoyance, or fighter; rather, we want to honor our collective ability to
help on another be more thoughtful through assertive caring critique. New points of view,
alternative insights, or alternative judgments are essential ingredients in the difficult job of persistent
growth.
## 4. Demonstrate a new source of meaning and insight for the rest of the class by providing a link,

relationship, or integration between two ideas, components of the assignment, or elements of the
course.
## 5. Provoke new ideas or arguments by asking questions that require the rest of us to ponder what we

thought we already knew.
## 6. Reflect exploration of relevant articles, books, films, music, poetry or conversations that extend

beyond what has been assigned. For example, evidence that you read a serious newspaper regularly
and use that experience to enrich the class makes you a more valuable member of the class.
## 7. Make effective use of the concepts and facts learned in the course. Think of the course as, in part, a

language course. In such a course, as you know, you belong to or fit in the class to the extent that
you are able to use that language as your think.
## 8. Demonstrate a lack of defensiveness when others question or criticize your views. To put this

criterion in another form, indicate to yourself and others that you are open to intellectual challenge
and growth.

Critical Thinking
(from The Miniature Guide to Critical Thinking: Concepts and Tools by Richard Paul and Linda Elder)
Definition: Critical thinking is self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. It
presupposes assent to rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use. It entails
effective communication and problem solving abilities and a commitment to overcome our native
egocentrism and sociocentrism.
### A Checklist for Reasoning

## 1. All reasoning has a purpose.

*  Take time to state your purpose clearly.
*  Distinguish your purpose from related purposes.
*  Check periodically to be sure you are still on target.
*  Choose significant and realistic purposes.
## 2. All reasoning is an attempt to FIGURE something out, to settle some QUESTION, and solve some PROBLEM.

*  Take time to clearly and precisely state the question at issue.
*  Express the question in several ways to clarify its meaning and scope.
*  Break the question into sub-questions.
### *  Identify if the question has one right answer, is a matter of mere opinion, or requires reasoning from more

than one point of view.
## 2. All reasoning is based on ASSUMPTIONS.

*  Clearly identify your assumptions and determine wh4ether they are justifiable.
*  Consider how your assumptions are shaping your point of view.
## 3. All reasoning is done from some POINT OF VIEW.

*  Identify your point of view.
*  Seek other points of view and identify their strengths as well as weaknesses.
*  Strive to be fair-minded in evaluating all points of view.
## 4. All reasoning is based on DATA, INFORMATION AND EVIDENCE.

*  Restrict your claims to those supported by the data you have.
*  Search for information that opposes your position as well as information that supports it.
*  Make sure that all information used is clear, accurate, and relevant to the question at issue.
*  Make sure you have gathered sufficient information.
## 5. All reasoning is expressed through, and shaped by, CONCEPTS AND IDEAS.

*  Identify key concepts and explain them clearly.
*  Consider alternative concepts or alternative definitions to concepts.
*  Make sure you are using concepts with care and precision.
## 6. All reasoning contains INFERENCES OR INTERPRETATIONS by which we draw CONCLUSIONS and give

meaning to data.
*  Infer only what the evidence implies.
*  Check inferences for their consistency with each other.
*  Identify assumptions which lead you to your interviews.
## 7. All reasoning leads somewhere or has IMPLICATIONS AND CONSEQUENCES.

*  Trace the implications and consequences that follow from your reasoning.
*  Search for negative as well as positive implications.
*  Consider all possible consequences.
