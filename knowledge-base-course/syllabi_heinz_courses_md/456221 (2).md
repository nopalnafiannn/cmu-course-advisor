Driven by the combination of increased access to data, computational power, and improved
sensors and algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are entering the mainstream of
technological innovation. These technologies include search, computer vision, and natural
language processing
The course begins by describing artificial intelligence and provide some examples of AI
applications to place developments in the field in historical perspective. We will then do a deep
dive into some of the applications underlying search, several varieties of machine learning,
computer vision, and natural language processing. The course concludes with a discussion of
ethical implications of AI, and a glimpse into potential futures of AI. Exercises will include
hands-on application of basic AI techniques as well as selection of appropriate technologies for a
given problem and anticipation of design implications. In a final project, groups of students will
have the option either of applying natural language processing techniques, or of critically
evaluating a recent development in AI (of their choice) by applying published techniques to new
data.

Course Learning Outcomes
### The main learning objectives of the course are to:

## 1. Identify problems where artificial intelligence techniques are applicable

## 2. Apply selected basic AI techniques; judge applicability of more advanced techniques.

## 3. Participate in the design of systems that act intelligently and learn from experience.

An online site with this syllabus, readings, and other resources has been created in Canvas at
https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/42832 . The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and
efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching
staff, we encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. Find our class signup link at
https://piazza.com/cmu/fall2024/95891a1/info .

Text
The primary reference for the course is Russell, S. & Norvig, P. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern
Approach, Pearson, 2020. This is the fourth edition of the leading textbook in AI, generally
accepted as the most comprehensive reference on the subject. It is a substantial update to the
third edition, so investing in the latest edition is worthwhile, especially if you plan to do further
work in AI. One copy is also available on virtual reserve through the CMU library. This text will
be supplemented by on-line material as listed in the course outline below.

Homework, final projects and grading
There will be 2 homework assignments, meant to be done individually, each due at midnight
(Eastern Time) per the following schedule:
Assignment Due
### 1) Search Sep 12

2) Computer vision Sep 26
Each assignment will count for 15 percent of the grade, for 30 percent of the grade. Late
assignments (without a written excuse for medical/family/etc. emergencies) will be penalized at
the rate of 10% of the assignment’s grade per day late. Three closed-book quizzes on Sep 6, Sep
19, and Oct 3 will count for another 30 percent of the grade. There is no final exam for this
class. A final project presentation and report will count for 20 percent of the grade. The final
projects are meant to be done in groups, which should split the work equally and report who did
what in the final report. The remaining 20 percent will be based on class attendance and
participation in discussions in the lecture sessions (Tuesdays and Thursdays). In-person
attendance is required for attendance credit, unless there are medical circumstances requiring
remote attendance. One absence is permitted with further absences causing a proportional
deduction in the class participation grade. When you must miss class, please notify me (at least
24 hours in advance except for illness/emergency), so that we can discuss alternative
arrangements for catching up on class and associated work. If you encounter extenuating
circumstances and must miss more than one class, please come and discuss the issue with me; I
would like to find a way to support you. Attendance at the Friday recitation sessions is strongly
encouraged they will present helpful information for the assignments, but is not mandatory.
### Grading will be on a straight scale as follows (with no rounding up):

A+ 98.0-100% B+ 88.0-89.9% C+ 78.0-79.9%
A 92.0-97.9% B 82.0-87.9% C 72.0-77.9%
A- 90.0-91.9% B- 80.0-81.9% C- 70.0-71.9%
Everyone taking the class should register for a letter grade. Auditing the class, or taking the class
Pass/Fail, is intended for extremely rare circumstances and only with consent of the instructor.

Academic Integrity
Students are expected to strictly follow Carnegie Mellon University rules of academic integrity
in this course. This means in particular that unless otherwise specified, homework are to be the
work of the individual student using only permitted material and without any cooperation of
other students or third parties. It also means that usage of work by others is only permitted in the
form of quotations and any such quotation must be distinctively marked to enable identification
of the student’s own work and own ideas. All external sources used must be properly cited,
including author name(s), publication title, year of publication, and a complete reference needed
for retrieval. The same work may not be submitted for credit in multiple courses. Violations will
be penalized to the full extent mandated by the CMU policies. There will be no exceptions.

Certain assignments in this course will permit or even encourage the use of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT. When AI use is permissible, it will be clearly stated in
the assignment prompt posted in Canvas. Otherwise, the default is that use of generative AI is
disallowed. In assignments where generative AI tools are allowed, their use must be
appropriately acknowledged and cited. For instance, if you generated the whole document
through ChatGPT and edited it for accuracy, your submitted work would need to include a note
such as “I generated this work through Chat GPT and edited the content for accuracy.”
Paraphrasing or quoting smaller samples of AI generated content must be appropriately
acknowledged and cited, following the guidelines established by the APA Style Guide. It is each
student’s responsibility to assess the validity and applicability of any AI output that is submitted.

You may not earn full credit if inaccurate on invalid information is found in your work.

Deviations from the guidelines above will be considered violations of CMU’s academic integrity
policy. Note that expectations for “plagiarism, cheating, and acceptable assistance” on student
work may vary across your courses and instructors. Please email me if you have questions
regarding what is permissible and not for a particular course or assignment.

Diversity
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this
course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity
that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to
present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and
appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you
personally or for other students or student groups.

Disability Accommodations
If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office,
I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as
possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you
suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet
registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at
access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Mental Health
As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as
strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating
and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your
academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services
are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health
services available on campus at: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Support is always available
(24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412-268-2922.
