Governance II
Spring 2025 Course Syllabus
Instructor

Email: ngeorge1@andrew.cmu.edu
Course Description
This course complements technical understanding with key economic, policy, and governance
frameworks that explain critical challenges in security and privacy for individuals, firms, and the
nation. We will focus on why policies are needed in this space and evaluate the pros and cons
of different policy approaches, analyzing key security events through specific economic and
policy principles to understand why stakeholders often don't do the "right" thing.

This course is based on Prof. Rahul Telang's class and draws on his recorded lectures and
other class materials, with some changes. There is no textbook, and most reading materials are
provided on the first day of class. Lecture notes, links to lecture videos, and links to all reading
materials are available at the Canvas course site.

A familiarity with economics is expected.

Course Expectations
The lectures and assignments cover conceptual material, and students are encouraged to read
the materials listed and link them to the class material to develop a deeper understanding of the
topics. Students are also expected to share relevant and interesting material with their fellow
class participants and engage in class discussions via the Piazza platform.
