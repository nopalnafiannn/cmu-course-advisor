Course Description
Agentic AI is transforming industries—from autonomous decision-making in finance to intelligent policy
simulations and gaming AI. With rapid advances in LLM-powered agents, multi-agent collaboration, and AIdriven simulations, agentic technology is now one of the most dynamic areas of research and investment. This
course bridges the gap between traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) and modern agentic AI, equipping
participants with both foundational principles and cutting-edge techniques for building autonomous, decisionmaking AI systems.

Designed for both AI strategists and developers, the course is offered in two modes: a no-code track for those
seeking conceptual and strategic insights into AI-driven multi-agent systems, and a programming track for

those wanting hands-on experience using AutoGen, LangChain, and other agent frameworks. Through
interactive exercises, real-world case studies, and hands-on implementation, students will explore the evolution
of emergent vs. programmed behaviors, the role of LLM-based multi-agent architectures in AI-driven
decision-making, and the application of strategic policy simulations, economic modeling, and AI-driven
research automation.

The course blends theory and practice, ensuring students gain both a deep conceptual understanding and
practical skills in designing, deploying, and evaluating autonomous AI agents. It delves into key challenges
such as validation, benchmarking, and responsible AI governance, equipping participants with the frameworks
necessary to assess the performance, reliability, and ethical considerations of AI-driven agents.

By the end of the course, participants will be prepared to leverage agent-based modeling and AI-driven agents
for solving complex real-world problems. Whether you’re a business leader, AI researcher, software engineer,
or policymaker, this course provides the knowledge and tools to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of
agentic AI and drive innovation in intelligent systems.
### Learning Objectives:

## 1. Master Foundations of Agent-Based Modeling and Agentic AI – Explain the evolution of agentbased modeling (ABM), its role in complex adaptive systems, and its integration with LLM-based

multi-agent architectures, digital twins, and generative agents for real-world decision-making and
intelligent simulations.
## 2. Differentiate and Apply Emergent vs. Programmed Behaviors – Analyze the distinction between

emergent behaviors in self-organizing agents and explicitly programmed decision-making models,
applying these concepts to domains such as smart cities, healthcare, and logistics through hands-on
simulations.
## 3. Design and Implement Specialized AI Agents – Develop tool agents for automation, coding agents

for AI-assisted software development, gaming agents for adaptive simulations, economic agents for
market modeling, and strategic agents for policy simulations, leveraging frameworks like LangChain,
AutoGen, NetLogo, and AnyLogic.
## 4. Integrate Large Language Models in Agentic Systems – Apply LLM-based agents to multi-agent

interactions, enhancing decision-making with reasoning, memory, and planning capabilities through
architectures such as ReAct, Large Action Models (LAMs), and autonomous workflow orchestration.
## 5. Leverage Multi-Agent Systems for Real-World Applications – Implement cooperative,

competitive, and hybrid multi-agent systems for business automation, economic forecasting,
regulatory policy analysis, and autonomous decision-making in complex environments.
## 6. Evaluate, Benchmark, and Optimize Agentic AI – Apply agent benchmarking frameworks such as

AgentBoard to assess adaptability, robustness, performance, and ethical alignment in multi-agent
interactions.
## 7. Navigate Risks, Governance, and Societal Impact of AI Agents – Examine AI governance

frameworks from OECD, NIST, and regulatory bodies to address risks in agent autonomy, recursive
agent design, bias mitigation, security vulnerabilities, and economic or social disruption from agentdriven decision-making.

This course is designed for graduate-level students. All students are expected to have a background on machine
learning and AI. The programming track assignments require a good understanding of deep learning and

Course Policies
### *  Academic Integrity & Collaboration: Students are expected to strictly follow Carnegie Mellon

University rules of academic integrity in this course. This means that unless otherwise specified,
Individual assignments are to be the work of the individual student using only permitted material and
without any cooperation of other students or third parties. It also means that usage of work by others is
only permitted in the form of quotations and any such quotation must be distinctively marked to
enable identification of the student’s own work and own ideas. All external sources used must be
properly cited, including author name(s), publication title, year of publication, and a complete
reference needed for retrieval. The same work may not be submitted for credit in multiple courses.

Violations will be penalized to the full extent mandated by the CMU policies. There will be no
exceptions.
### *  Use of Generative AI Tools: We encourage students to explore the use of generative artificial

intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, for all individual assignments. Any such use must be
appropriately acknowledged and cited, following the guidelines established by the APA Style Guide,
including the specific version of the tool used. Submitted work should include the exact prompt used
to generate the content as well as the AI’s full response in an Appendix. Because AI generated content
is not necessarily accurate or appropriate, it is each student’s responsibility to assess the validity and
applicability of any generative AI output that is submitted. You may not earn full credit if inaccurate,
invalid, or inappropriate information is found in your work. Deviations from these guidelines will be
considered violations of CMU’s academic integrity policy.
