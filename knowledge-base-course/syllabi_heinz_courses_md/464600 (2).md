Course Course Title: 95-712 Object Oriented Programming in Java
Information Instructor: Marty Barrett (martinba@andrew.cmu.edu)
Prerequisites None
Description: This course is an in-depth look at the popular programming language Java. It is not
intended for first time programmers.

After some preliminaries devoted to basic syntax and program structure, classes,
composition, inheritance and polymorphism are examined. The Java collection classes
are studied in some detail, as is the rather complex set of I/O classes. Additional topics
include exception handling, building GUIs, and multi-threading. Throughout the second
half of the course, a series of homework problems develops a non-toy application,
illustrating by example how larger object-oriented programs are organized.

### Course Policies & Policies

Exceptions
## 1. Collaboration, using ChatGPT, CoPilot, and other AI tools: Collaboration is

permitted in Labs but not on any other assignments. Copying code without citing its
source is cheating (including LLMs). Copying code from a fellow student is cheating.

You may choose to use a large language model to assist with your programming work.

Note that LLMs often make mistakes. You are responsible for any errors or problems
that may be present in the code that you submit. The closed book exams are designed to
test your knowledge and coding skills. So, if you do use a large language model, be sure
to master the material and truly understand the code before taking an exam.

However, your responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow the
academic integrity guidelines of the university and of this class. If you use one of
these generative AI tools to develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite
the tool’s contribution to your work, just as you should cite code acquired from any other
source.

If you copy code from the Web, be sure to provide a comment in the code with the exact
URL where the code was copied from. In practice, cutting and pasting content from any
source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing content from a generative
AI without citation is plagiarism. Similarly, using any generative AI tool without
appropriate acknowledgement will be treated as plagiarism. The university’s policy on
plagiarism applies to all uncited or improperly cited use of work, whether that work is
created by human beings alone or in collaboration with a generative AI. Provide as a
comment in the code the exact URL where the code was copied from.

Code that is provided by the instructors is allowed as long as the code is clearly cited as
being provided by the instructors. Of course, if you have violated the spirit of the project,
you will earn zero points.

In addition to any penalties imposed by the instructor, all cheating and plagiarism
infractions will be reported in writing to the Associate Dean for the program, the
Associate Dean of Faculty, the Dean of Student Affairs, and the Dean. They will review
and determine if expulsion should be recommended. The report will become part of the
student’s record.

The appropriate people to refer to for help in homework projects are the TAs and the
instructors. They can look at your code and help you with it. See them during office
hours.

## 2. Videos & Self-assessments: There is a significant part of course-content provided in

the form of videos that you must watch before coming to the class each week. This will
introduce you to the week's content. After watching each week’s videos before Sunday
midnight, complete the weekly self-assessment based on the video-content for which you
will get two attempts. The higher of the two scores will be considered for grading.
## 3. Weekly Quiz: There are short multiple-choice quizzes through the semester. Lowest

quiz score will be dropped.
## 4. Lab assignments: There are lab exercises after each lecture through the semester.

Each lab exercise is a short programming problem related to a topic discussed in the
previous class for which you will submit a Java program before the end of the class.

Lowest score will be dropped. Consider labs as a practice exam. You will have full
access to all the references, but you will have to produce the final solution individually.

You can consult with me, the TAs or your classmates during labs. Submissions dates and
times are marked on each lab assignment, this is two days after being assigned.
## 5. Homework: There are 3 homework assignments and all three will be considered for

your final grade. They will be due on Fridays at 11.59 PM of the week in which they are
listed.
## 6. Midterm Exams: There are 3 mid-exams during the semester comprising questions

and a programming test.

Final Exam: The format of final exam is similar to mid-exams but longer and is
cumulative.

Others
## 7. Class Attendance: As evident from all the activities listed above, labs, quizzes, and

exams require your presence in the class. If you miss any lab / quiz / exam, it will be
adjusted as the lowest score. No makeup lab / quiz / exam will be accepted unless there is
an emergency, in which case a documented evidence may be required. Job interviews do
not count as an emergency. You are expected to be present in-person in class for the labs
and MUST be present for the exams. Attempts to take the exams from outside the class
without instructor’s written permission will be considered as integrity violation and will
be dealt with as per university policies.

Grades
## 8. Grade disputes, if any, must be reported to the TA or the instructor within one week

from the day of grade-distribution.
## 9. While you will have the flexibility to take help from your classmates on lab exercises,

all other activities– quiz, homework, and exams – are meant to be your individual work.

Copying from any source without citation, sharing your work with other students,
or copying from other students will be considered as cheating and plagiarism and
will be addressed according to the university policies
http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/.
### Any violations of academic integrity in this class will have the following consequences:

a. No credit for the assignment in question and lowering of the final grade by one letter
(e.g. from B to C).

b. In more serious offenses, failing the class.

All incidents are reported to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity at
Carnegie Mellon University. Additional penalties may be imposed.
## 10. All work must be submitted in Canvas by the due date/time.

If you experience upload problems with Canvas, email me your work for grading
IMMEDIATELY, AND PRIOR TO, THE DUE DATE/TIME, along with a screenshot
of the upload error. When emailing me your work, I also need you to email technical
information to validate the issue (type out what the error message is that you are
receiving, computer information, network information, file information, date/time of
attempted upload, and screenshot of error) prior to the due date/time via email to me or
you will receive a 0% on the corresponding assignment. I need the error information so I
can validate your excuse with Canvas administration – it must be validated by error
logging. If you contact me about Canvas submission issues after the due/date time, I
cannot help you.
## 11. Late Policy:

Unless otherwise stated, no assignments will be accepted late. On the rare occasion that
an assignment is announced that it can be submitted late, the assignment will be accepted
with a penalty of 10% of the total worth of the assignment per day late, up to and
including the late deadline announced. Do *not* ask me to make special exceptions for
you and you alone – that is NOT fair to the rest of the class. NO assignments may ever
be delivered by email. Please do not ask to have a Canvas assignment re-opened online
for late submission. Budget for upload time to Canvas. All assignments are due by the
start time of the class which it is due (unless otherwise noted).
# OTHER POLICIES

### Students with Disabilities:

Our community values diversity and seeks to promote meaningful access to educational
opportunities for all students. CMU and your instructors are committed to your success
and to supporting Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended and the
Americans with Disabilities Act (1990). This means that in general no individual who is
otherwise qualified shall be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity, solely by reason of having a
disability.

If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact us ASAP,
and we will work together to ensure that you have the correct access to resources on
campus to assist you through your coursework and time at CMU.
### Academic Integrity:

Carnegie Mellon University sets high standards for academic integrity. Those standards
are supported and enforced by students, including those who serve as academic integrity
hearing panel members and hearing officers. The presumptive sanction for a first offense
is no credit on the assignment in question and lowering the final grade by one letter,
accompanied by the transcript notation “Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.”

The standard sanction for a second offense is failing the course. Please see
http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/ for any questions.

All incidents are reported to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity at
CMU. Additional penalties may be imposed.
### Cell Phones, Smartphones and other handheld wireless devices:

Other than during class breaks, please silence ring tones and refrain from engaging in
calls, messaging or other use during class time. All devices must not be visible during
quizzes.
### Use of Canvas System for this course:

The Heinz School uses Carnegie Mellon University’s Canvas system to facilitate
distance learning as well as to enhance main campus courses. In this course, we will use
the Canvas system generally to post lecture notes and related documents and to receive
assignments electronically from students.
### Take care of yourself:

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will
help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are
many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college
experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is
often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life
events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and
visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend,
faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can
help.

If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone
immediately, day or night:
