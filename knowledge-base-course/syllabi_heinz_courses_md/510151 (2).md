# COURSE DESCRIPTION

Communication in written form is an essential element of management. Writing for business-focused,
industry-specific contexts differs from academic writing. Accordingly, this course focuses on teaching
transferable, career-enhancing writing skills: developing essential and persuasive content, applying
logic, organizing information, targeting diverse audiences with varying levels of expertise and roles,
addressing feasibility, ensuring clarity, controlling tone, maintaining format norms, and designing
documents for readability and accessibility. The course challenges students to meet readers’ needs
by conveying critical thinking via anticipating the perspectives of stakeholders in professional
situations. Coursework emphasizes precise, concise phrasing in actionable communications. Digital
tips and strategies for collaborative writing will be discussed. Writing resources and sample
documents will be provided.

Note: This course assumes proficiency in English grammar. Numerous resources for improving written
English skills are provided via Canvas.
# COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES

● Differentiate the format and style of professional writing from personal and academic writing
● Determine the purpose and scope of the message
● Distinguish between essential and non-essential information
● Target writing to particular readers, rather than preparing generic material
● Demonstrate writing as a tool to build and maintain professional relationships
● Communicate complex, data-heavy topics accurately using specific, plain language
● Maintain a logical structure through calculated organizational methods
● Format headings, lists, data, citations and visuals with a focus on precision and consistency
● Create efficiently phrased, actionable communications for use in a workplace
● Edit documents thoroughly prior to distribution
# REGISTRATION

Once a section is full, enrollment is dependent on: (1) the number of registered students who drop the
section, and (2) the waitlist order. Students who miss the first class meeting can be automatically
dropped from the course. After the initial session, registration is closed.

# LEARNING RESOURCES

Required Texts
● Management Communications:
https://www.oercommons.org/courses/management-communication/view
● Materials provided via Canvas - handouts, excerpts, and links to video/audio content
Required Technology
● Canvas- this course will utilize this central Learning Management System (LMS) where
students will be expected to access materials and upload assignments.
● Laptop/tablet in class –class sessions will frequently consist of in-class workshops, small
group work, scaffolding assignments, and revision work. Students should plan to bring the
device of their choice to class to complete this in-class work.
# SYLLABUS MODIFICATIONS

This syllabus – especially the homework and assignment schedule – may be modified as the
semester progresses in order to meet the course outcomes and best address the needs of members
of the class. Pay close attention to course announcements posted on Canvas and made in class for
any of these changes which may alter our modality or course delivery options.

In the case of inclement weather, the University will post announcements about school closures,
delayed openings or early closings - we will adjust our course modality based on CMU’s
determinations.
# TEACHING ASSISTANTS

Each section of this course will have a TA. Contact information and office hours will be posted on
Canvas, under the “Pages” tab in the first week of the mini. The TA can answer questions, respond to
issues, direct you to resources, and work through assignments with you.
# COMMUNICATION POLICIES

● Email is my preferred mode of communication and the fastest way to get in touch with me.

The Canvas messaging system is not as reliable and should be avoided.
● Please include your name and section number and CC the TA for your course section in all
emails
● Please allow a minimum of 24 hours for me to respond to all emails
● Students are expected to check their CMU emails and Canvas regularly
● I can not discuss grades via email; please come to office hours with questions pertaining to
grades.
● If we talk about something before class starts or in the hallway (an extension, a revision,
another project you’d like feedback on), please plan to send me a follow up email confirming
the details.
# OFFICE HOURS POLICIES

Every week, I set aside office hours or a reserved block of time to meet with students. This is the ideal
time for students to get one-on-one feedback, ask questions, or discuss concerns. You are welcome
to drop in to my office during office hours or, if you have a specific topic you want to discuss (or a
tight schedule), feel free to email to make a specific appointment. I am happy to meet in person or
via Zoom.

If you are unable to attend my scheduled office hours due to a conflict, we can set up an
appointment at another time. If an emergency arises so you cannot make a scheduled appointment,
please contact me by email as soon as possible.
# ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION POLICY

In keeping with CMU and Heinz’s expectations and policies, you are expected to attend all scheduled
classes. The expectation from Heinz is that you will attend every class in-person in our designated
classroom.

However, a commitment to accessibility, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, presents
challenges to maintaining any graded attendance policy that is equitable and based in care and
safety. As your professor, I recognize and acknowledge that we can not make assumptions about
others’ experiences and as a result, we ought to offer compassion, patience, and grace to one
another as best we can. Therefore, there are options available to help students who may need
occasional asynchronous attendance options (i.e. family emergencies, illness).

For the purposes of this policy, “attendance” is defined as arriving physically in our classroom during
our regularly scheduled class period. “Participation” covers a broad range of interactive
opportunities, both synchronous and asynchronous, that demonstrate engagement with the course
content. These participation opportunities include:
● Speaking during class discussions (asking questions, responding to discussion questions)
● Collaborating with classmates and posting required in-class discussions, small group work,
and homework to Canvas
● Providing peer review feedback to classmates
● Attending office hours (in-person or virtually) with questions, concerns, etc.
● Offering constructive feedback to classmates, adding to ongoing discussions, or practicing
additional skills via asynchronous discussion boards on Canvas.

This course focuses on professional development skills; as such, professional conduct will be
expected of all participants. Students should expect to behave during class as they would in a staff or
client meeting. Students should make a good faith effort to attend class prepared, to interact with
peers and the professor on a regular basis, and demonstrate respect for all class participants
through verbal and non-verbal modes. Students who engage in abusive or harmful speech will be
immediately excused from class.

Assessment for participation will be a holistic measure of a student’s work on a daily basis and is
based on more than mere presence in the classroom. Active participation includes engaging in
active listening, offering constructive, skills-based feedback, and adding to class conversation on a
daily basis. Students should plan to raise their hands often and come to class prepared to engage in
hands-on activities, workshops, and discussions.

Students should refrain from doing other coursework, sleeping, conducting personal business,
or other forms of “multitasking” while in class; students observed frequently engaging in this
kind of multitasking may have their participation grades lowered.

Students who miss a significant number of classes (which means both failing to attend the in-person
class sessions AND failing to participate in the asynchronous makeup course options) may be issued
a lower or failing grade.

Students who have religious observations, medical/personal emergencies, or other major difficulties
that will result in multiple missed synchronous classes are encouraged to contact the professor/TA as
soon as possible.

If you are absent from class, materials will be posted on Canvas, but you should also plan to reach
out to a classmate to find out what you missed. Assignments are due on their due dates regardless
of absences, unless a student is specifically issued an extension.

For this course, I will be recording class sessions and making them available to you for your personal,
educational use. Recordings of class sessions are covered under the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act (FERPA) and must not be shared with anyone outside your course-section. The purpose
of these recordings is so students in this course (and only students in this course) can watch or
re-watch past class sessions. Feel free to use the recordings if you would like to review something we
discussed in class or if you are temporarily unable to attend class.
# LATE ARRIVAL POLICY

Obviously, the occasional emergency can disrupt even the most organized person’s schedule;
however, habitual lateness is considered unprofessional and inconsiderate. Students who arrive
habitually late to class (more than five minutes late) during the semester may have their grades
lowered. If circumstances will hinder your ability to arrive on time regularly, please speak with the
professor to discuss arrangements.
# DRAFTS AND PROJECT STAGES

Drafts and project stages are a vital part of the writing process and therefore a required part of the
course. Writing is a process that necessarily takes time; the project stages of this course are designed
to help students focus on improving both their own personal process as well as final deliverables. As
a result, all project stages must be submitted in a timely fashion; the professor reserves the right to
refuse to accept a final deliverable without the accompanying required project stages. Project stages
can not be completed and submitted for credit after the project is submitted (i.e. you can not submit
your Proposal Draft after you have submitted the Proposal).
### For the purposes of this class, we will use the following terminology to discuss draft stages:

● “Rough draft” - first or second pass through a document, some stand-in content, ideas but
not polished or proofread, - ready for global feedback or specific questions in office hours
● “Supervisor ready draft” - complete, edited, proofread for errors, formatted, largely polished,
ready for high level feedback - required for peer review
● “Client ready draft” - nearly finished, polished, free of errors, looking for client input - ideal for
turning in
# LATE ASSIGNMENTS AND MISSING WORK

Late Assignment Penalties: Ideally, you will avoid turning in late work. Please plan to make use of
the extension policy to avoid these types of issues. In addition to the extension policy, this course has
a late work policy where assignments may be turned in late for up to 24 hours with a 20% deduction.

After 24 hours, students will need to schedule an office hours appointment to discuss any extended
due dates.

Missing Work: Due to the participatory nature of this course, it is important for work to be completed
in a timely manner. In-class discussions and activities are a vital part of your success in improving
your professional communication skills. I am dedicated to working with students to ensure they have
equitable access to the materials and flexibility to complete the work of the course across a broad
range of experiences.

However, work that is missing or is significantly incomplete may not be eligible to receive points
towards the course. Outside of the course policies and accommodations, students are expected to
put forth a good faith effort to complete the work of the course. Asynchronous or makeup work
should be completed within a week of the missed class, unless alternative new due dates have been
arranged with the professor.
# EXTENSION POLICY

Each student has a single extension which they may use on any individual project or project stage.
### To request an extension, students should:

## 1. Email the professor and TA no later than 24 hours prior to the deadline indicating your

desire to use your extension.
## 2. Provide a new, reasonable date and time for the assignment to be due. If the assignment is

a draft or project stage of a larger project, this date needs to come before the larger project
is due. For larger projects, this new date should be within a week* of the original due date.
a. This new date/time will be considered the new deadline for the assignment
b. A note will be added to Canvas with this new due date for mutual reference
c. The student will submit the assignment as instructed on the assignment sheet
d. The student should notify the professor and TA an email indicating you have
submitted your assignment and it is ready for grading.
*For end of semester projects, the professor may require a shorter extension window due to grading
deadlines
# ACADEMIC CONDUCT

Plagiarism is a serious offense that will result in the student failing the course. All academic integrity
violations will be reported to the associate dean's office for the student’s program of study and the
Carnegie Mellon University Division of Student Affairs. If an academic integrity violation is suspected,
the student will be contacted to meet with the instructor to determine if a violation has occurred
based on Carnegie Mellon University’s Policy on Academic Integrity.
### Note that plagiarism includes:

● Presenting another writer’s work (including computer/AI writers) as your own; this includes
written text but also data visualizations, charts/graphs, graphics and research.
● Cutting and pasting content verbatim without using quotation marks to indicate a direct
quote; this includes published work but also work produced collaboratively with classmates
● Inserting a direct quote or paraphrasing content without citing the source in-text using
footnotes, endnotes, or parenthetical citations with a corresponding Works Cited, References,
or Notes page – in a manner consistent with an APA, MLA, or Chicago style guide;
● Providing incomplete or incorrect information about the source cited;
● Over-relying on templates or other writers’ phrasing.

Also, submitting work written for another course is not acceptable. Consequently, a failing grade may
be issued for that assignment. Additional penalties may be imposed.

In addition to maintaining academic integrity, this course aims to maintain an open, ethical,
respectful, collaborative atmosphere. This class, therefore, will not tolerate any discrimination on the
basis of race, color, age, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, martial status, disability,
or status as a veteran. Alternative, even conflicting viewpoints, are welcome in class discussion
(including those that take place online). However, statements that are racist, sexist, homophobic,
classist, or otherwise discriminatory to others, either inside or outside the class, will not be tolerated.

A Note about Generative AI like ChatGPT
Within this class, there are situations and contexts where the use of AI programs such as ChatGPT,
Bard, DALL-E and others will be expected. Together we will experiment with these emerging
technologies to explore how they can be used and better understand their benefits and limitations.

Learning how to use AI is an emerging skill and we will work through the implications of these
evolving systems together.

However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of these programs. Large language models
frequently provide users with incorrect information, create professional-looking citations that are not
real, generate contradictory statements, incorporate copyrighted material without appropriate
attribution, and can sometimes integrate biased concepts. You are ultimately responsible for the
content that you submit; work that is inaccurate, biased, unethical, offensive, plagiarized, or incorrect
will be penalized.

Similarly, using generative AI tools does not absolve you from your existing responsibilities as a
student to follow the academic integrity guidelines of the university and of this class. Turning in any
assignment with generative AI content outside of the allowable uses identified in this section may
constitute an academic integrity violation. If you have any questions about acceptable use, it is highly
encouraged to ask before you use it on any assignment that you will turn in for a grade for this
course.
### In this class, you may use Generative AI programs for the following with appropriate attribution:

● Brainstorm new ideas
● Develop example outlines or approaches to your work (“writer’s block breaker”)
● Work through in-class scenarios when directed
● Proofread, polish, or otherwise edit the content of the material you plan to submit
● Summarize, explain or quiz you on textbook or lecture material
● Iterate on ideas for titles, headings, or specific phrasing
### You may NOT use generative AI programs to:

● Complete a task you have been assigned to do in order to build communication skills (i.e.
“please rewrite this document but change the audience from a co-worker to my boss.”)
● Generate answers to discussion questions, reflection quizzes or other homework assignments
in lieu of engaging with the work yourself (i.e. copy the assignment prompt into ChatGPT and
paste the response into the assignment).
● Generate content that you cut and paste into an assignment with a written component
without quotations and a citation or that is not adequately paraphrased and lacks citation
● Research topics or generate bibliographies for topics that you have not researched yourself
● Generate other content (images, video, graphs, charts, data visualizations, others) unless
expressly permitted and following provided guidance
● Otherwise use or present generative AI content that you pass off as your own work
Any student using GenAI for any purpose in their assignments MUST include appropriate
citations in line with the assignment parameters AND must submit the chat transcript of their
collaborative work with the AI. Failure to cite and submit this supporting documentation constitutes
an academic integrity violation similar to forgetting to submit a works cited or leaving sources out of
a bibliography.

# ASYNCHRONOUS COURSE MAKEUP POLICY

Our course this semester has an in-person meeting expectation – please plan to attend all of the
scheduled classes in person. However, if you are ill or experiencing an emergency, the course does
have an asynchronous makeup option. If you are sick, especially with symptoms of COVID-19, RSV
or the flu, please do not come to class.

You must complete each of the following items for a missed class in order to receive full credit for
asynchronous attendance and participation credit for a missed class. Due to the nature of a mini
course, this asynchronous participation is expected to be completed within 48 hours of the missed
class, unless another deadline has been arranged with the professor.

If you are experiencing severe illness or other personal emergencies, please be in touch with the
professor and TA as soon as possible. Your health and safety are our top priority; we can make
accommodations to help you keep up with the coursework once you are healthy.
### To Complete a Missed Class Asynchronously:

## 1. Notify the professor and your TA that you will be missing class as soon as possible.

## 2. Watch the Zoom recording of class when it is posted on Canvas (usually a few hours after

class)
## 3. Use the “Asynchronous Discussion Board” on our Canvas site to post responses to the in-class

discussion (aim to respond to 2-3 discussion questions,) as you would have if you were in
class.
a. In general, the discussion questions are also available on the lecture slides for the
class period, though the in-person discussion sometimes jumps to other topics or
addresses only a few of those questions, depending on time constraints.
## 4. Use the Canvas Discussion Boards to complete the in-class activities that your classmates

completed during class time (as applicable).
## 5. Notify your course TA when you have completed all of these makeup items in order to

receive attendance and participation credit for the missed class.
