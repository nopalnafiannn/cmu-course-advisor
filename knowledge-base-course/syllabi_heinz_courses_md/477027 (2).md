## 1.0 Introduction

The purpose of this course is to provide a clinical learning environment that involves the use
of electronic, relational databases through original data collection as well as data obtained largely
from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the US federal government. Students are expected
to readily manipulate large, administrative databases to characterize a scio-economic
environment, evaluate it, and analyze the implications for changing key policy variables. They
may also engage in survey research and case studies when such public databases are not readily
available. Students are expected to develop an understanding of the institutional rules of current
law, and predict through the manipulation of data the effects of changes in current law.

The course is organized as follows: a client, a review panel, and a professor responsible for
overseeing the project and issuing a grade to each student. The course, 90780 Pennsylvania Data
Laboratory, taught by Professor Robert Strauss qualifies as such a required project course for
graduation.
## 2.0 Background

In December, 1999, the US Environmental Protection Agency finalized Phase 1 rules
governing the regulation of storm water discharges1. Subsequently, through Act 68 of 2013, the
Pennsylvania General Assembly enabled Pennsylvania Municipal Authorities to provide storm
water runoff services as follows:
“The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
hereby enacts as follows:
## Section 1. Section 5607(a) of Title 53 of the Pennsylvania

### Consolidated Statutes is amended by adding a paragraph to read:

§ 5607. Purposes and powers.
(a) Scope of projects permitted.--Every authority
incorporated under this chapter shall be a body corporate and
politic and shall be for the purposes of financing working
capital; acquiring, holding, constructing, financing, improving,
maintaining and operating, owning or leasing, either in the
capacity of lessor or lessee, projects of the following kind and
character and providing financing for insurance reserves:
* * *
(18) Storm water planning, management and implementation
as defined in the articles of incorporation by the governing
body. Authorities, existing as of the effective date of this
paragraph, already operating storm water controls as part of
a combined sewer system, sanitary sewer system or flood
control project may continue to operate those projects.
* * *
## Section 2. This act shall take effect in 60 days.

APPROVED--The 9th day of July, A.D. 2013.”

### The Commonwealth Court observed in its January, 2023 opinion2 that:

“In DeKalb County, Georgia v. United States, 108 Fed. Cl. 681 (Fed. Cl. 2013), the United
States Court of Federal Claims held that a county ordinance imposing a stormwater charge
similarly calculated according to the impervious surface area of developed properties constituted
a tax, rather than a fee for service, which the federal government was immune from paying. See
108 Fed. Cl. at 686 & 710.”
On January 4, 2023, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania agreed with West Chester
University and the State System of Higher Education’s argument before them that the Borough
of West Chester’s storm water runoff charge was a “property tax” rather than a fee. As such the
finding that the storm water charge was legally a property tax vacated the University’s obligation
to pay the City of West Chester because the University is exempt under the Pennsylvania
Constitution from paying property taxes. The matter has been appealed to the Pennsylvania State
Supreme Court.
## 3. Research Questions and Scope of 90-780

### The Fall 2024 Pennsylvania Data Impact Project seeks to answer the following questions:

Q1] How significant are storm water runoff charges to the budgets of Pennsylvania local
governments in terms of financing the provision of storm water infrastructure services, and the
burden such charges constitute for individuals, businesses, and local governments?

Comment: A preliminary review of the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic
Development statistical reporting systems indicates that stormwater charges are separately
reported for municipal authorities, and that underlying independent audit reports in electronic
form are available3. Other sources of information to be examined would be the electronic records
of the Governments Division of the US Census Bureau, and selected bond offer statements of
Q2] How have other states enabled their local governments to establish and provide storm water
runoff services? Have such mechanisms been free of Pennsylvania’s “fees” vs. “property tax”
controversies, and/or resolved in local and state courts?

Comment: This will entail a literature review of various legal and public utility research
literatures, and reading and summarizing state public utility statutes for some or all other states in
the area of permissible financing mechanisms for stormwater run off services.

Q3] What are the storm water run off fees typically used to pay for? Operations, maintenance,
new infrastructure?

Comment: determining the nexus between storm water runoff charges and water storm runoff
infrastructure likely will be a challenging undertaking and likely require a few case studies to
measure the range of practices currently in place.

Q4] What is the total potential financial liability, based on the extent of non-permeable surfaces
which is the current operational measure of various Pennsylvania stakeholders (residential
property owners, commercial property owners, non profits and exempt organizations (churches,
hospitals, universities, local governments (cities, townships, boroughs, townships, school
districts, county governments ) cost to pay for storm water runoff services?

Q5] Are there national implications for other states and their local governments of measurement
and findings in light of the national application of the EPA storm water run off requirements?

Comment: it is likely that current aerial photography and GIS systems can inform this for
various entities in Pennsylvania. If such data are not freely available, then this research question
will be narrowed.
