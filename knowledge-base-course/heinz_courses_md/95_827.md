# 95-827: Blockchain and SQL Fundamentals

## Course Information

**Units:** 6

## Description

This is a medley class that combines SQL (accessing and processing data stored in large, centralized data stores) and blockchain smart contracts (accessing and processing data stored in decentralized ledgers). There is significant interest in the industry for both approaches. The course is designed to provide the student with a serious and hands-on introduction to SQL and smart contract programming. Applications will primarily be chosen from the area of computational finance. The student should come to the class with knowledge of at least one programming language.

## Learning Outcomes

1. ... explain the role cryptography and peer-to-peer networks play in securing blockchain-based cryptocurrencies;
2. ... program and deploy smart contracts on an Ethereum test network;
3. ... understand the ERC-20 (fungible token) and ERC721 (non-fungible token) standards;
4. ...understand Automated Market Makers (such as Uniswap V2)
5. ...given an organizational need, identify the data needed to meet the need
6. ... query a database using SQL
7. ... discuss principles of database design
8. ... assess alternatives to the classic relational model (noSQL)

## Prerequisites

We assume that students have a programming course in their background. So, students will understand the following: syntax errors, logic errors, variables, types, assignment statements, functions, procedures, parameter passing, conditional expressions, iteration, problem-solving, and computational thinking.
