# 90-824: Cost Benefit Analysis

## Course Information

**Units:** 6

## Description

Individuals and organizations are frequently presented with decisions about how best to allocate limited resources. Public organizations in particular have an obligation to use consistent and transparent analytic tools to inform tradeoffs among competing policy priorities such as the environment, health, safety, and security. Economics provides a theoretical foundation for the allocation of scarce resources, but in practice, there are a variety of challenges in measuring benefits and costs in quantitative and monetary terms. Such challenges include determining how to value benefits and costs experienced in the future, reductions in the risk of premature death and injury, and the distribution of these impacts among affected populations, as well as appropriately characterizing uncertainty. The ability to assess key assumptions and limitations is critical for both producers and consumers of cost-benefit analysis.
