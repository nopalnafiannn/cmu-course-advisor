### OIice Hours:

Description: Generative AI has the potential to significantly
enhance developer productivity. This micro-mini course delves
into how Microsoft Copilot can be used for various tasks,
including code generation, chat assistance, refactoring,
unit testing, data file manipulation, and documentation.

Examples will span multiple programming languages, such
as Java, Python, and Javascript. The course will be
hands-on and involve teamwork. Everyone will need a
laptop to run code. There will be pre-work to set
up your environment and post-work to include a
short (1-to-3 page) paper.

Prerequisites: While there is no formal prerequisite, it is
assumed that students have some programming background.

Specifically, each student should be familiar with
concepts such as variables, data type, iteration, and
functions in at least one programming language (not
necessarily limited to Python or Java).

Attendance: Attendance is required and our grading will
primarily be based on class participation.

Grading: Attendance and class participation (90%).

Short paper (1-3 pages) (10%).

Paper: A short paper describing your own views on the
impact of large language models on the software development
process. Or, discuss your views on how large language models might impact computer science
education.

This will be due on the first Wednesday (at midnight) immediately
following the course. It will be posted to Canvas as a
single pdf file.

Dates: This micro course will meet from 9:00 AM until 1:00 PM on
Friday, October 25, Saturday, October 26, and Sunday, October 27.

Place: Hamburg Hall room 1002
### Learning Objectives:

## 1. Learn how to use Copilot to create prompts to generate code.

## 2. Evaluate the code generated by Copilot for correctness and style.

## 3. Understand issues related to Copilot's eIect on software

development productivity.

## 4. Utilize Copilot to assist with problem-solving using

pseudocode.
## 5. Investigate Copilot's ability to create correct documentation

from an existing code base.
## 6. Learn how Copilot can be used to generate tests.

## 7. Experiment with using Copilot to create code to process

various message formats (XML, JSON, CSS).
## 8. Understand Copilot's ability to assist with graphical

display languages (HTML, MathML, etc.).
## 9. Learn how Copilot can be used to translate existing

code into other languages.
## 10. Investigate various prompt patterns that may be used

to enhance Copilot prompts.
### Good health:

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain
a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking
some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals
and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during
times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many
helpful resources available on campus and an important
part of the college experience is learning how to ask
for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later
is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences
any academic stress, diIicult life events, or feelings
like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you
to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS)
is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website
here. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family
member you trust for help getting connected to the support
that can help.

If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal
or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or
night: CMU CaPS: 412-268-2922, Re:solve Crisis Network in
Pittsburgh: 888-796-8226
If the situation is life threatening,
call the police: On campus: CMU Police: 412-268-2323
