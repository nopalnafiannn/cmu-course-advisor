Description This course provides a comprehensive introduction to marketing research as used across several
entertainment industries (film, television, and videogaming). The course will discuss key concepts,
processes, and techniques, as well as their applications. The goal is to overview with students the
fundamentals of good research practices used by business enterprises, regardless of size (start-up or
established) and regardless of vertical.

The course is aimed at a user of research, rather than the one responsible for determining the scope and
direction of research activities. The goal is that by the end of this class students will be well-informed
and effective user-consumers of research at any company or occupation they go on to after graduation.

Students will learn that the techniques of research design, data collection, and data analysis play an
important role in the work of a marketing department, especially in regard to establishing strategy and
monitoring feedback from the marketplace and consumers.

This course focuses on providing students with the tools they need to understand and evaluate research
findings they will likely encounter as entertainment industry executives. The aim is to develop an
appreciation for the potential contributions and limitations of marketing research. Specific objectives
of this course are discussed in the following section.

Plagiarism and Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely serious
cheating notice* matters. Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the
most serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a
required paper or as cheating on an examination, including take-home as well as in-class
examinations. The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the MEIM
Program and Heinz School.
### Cheating includes but is not limited to:

## 1. Plagiarism (explained below);

## 2. Submission of work that is not the student’s own;

## 3. Submission or use of falsified data;

## 4. Unauthorized access to an exam or assignment;

## 5. Use of a stand‐in for an exam;

## 6. Use of unauthorized material in the preparation of an assignment or during an

examination;
## 7. Supplying or communicating unauthorized information to another student for use in an

assignment or exam;
## 8. Unauthorized collaboration on an assignment. Collaboration must be explicitly permitted

by an instructor for it to be considered authorized.
## 9. Submission of the same work for credit in more than one course.

Plagiarism is the failure to indicate the source of work either with quotation marks or
footnotes. The source can be a phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific language, or an
idea derived from the work of another person. Note that material on the web is another
person’s work and is therefore equally subject to the rules on plagiarism and cheating as any
other source material.

Cheating and/or plagiarism on an essay assignment will result in a failing grade (0
points) for that assignment. The essay in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded
from the offending student’s assignments included in grade calculations; the points for that
essay zero (0) will be factored into the grade.

Furthermore, the cheating student’s final grade will be reduced one full letter grade. A
cheating student’s final grade will be impacted significantly. In addition, cases of cheating and
plagiarism will be submitted to and reviewed by the Dean’s Office; more severe penalties may
be imposed, up to and including expulsion from the Heinz School.

Academic Dishonesty: Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards inside
and outside the classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e., plagiarism and
unauthorized collaboration) is obviously discouraged and will be treated appropriately. The
usual penalty for violations is a failing grade for the particular assignment in question;
however, in some instances, such actions may result in a failing grade for the course.

Intelligence prohibited. Using ChatGPT or other generative AI to generate any course content will be considered an
Policy: academic integrity violation.
