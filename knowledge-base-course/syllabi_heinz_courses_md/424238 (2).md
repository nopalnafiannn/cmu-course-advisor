Course Description
We have entered the era of Generative AI, which holds transformational potential akin to the
industrial revolution or the advent of the Internet. This technology is now capable of
comprehending and generating language, code, images, and videos, performing routine digital
tasks, and aiding humans in advancing scientific and creative fields.

These intelligent capabilities are powering novel AI user experiences such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT
and Dall-E, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot and various proprietary and open-source
offerings. These innovations can boost human productivity and creativity, but their impact on
society will be somewhat unpredictable long-term. By immersing ourselves in the study of
Generative AI, we not only equip ourselves for personal growth but also become architects of a
future where technology serves humanity’s highest aspirations.

In this course, students will explore the broad impacts of generative AI by considering its
applications, societal implications, and governance. We will explore how leveraging AI tools can
help us as individuals thrive in our personal and professional lives. We will learn how both
governments and private enterprises are seeking to develop beneficial and safe AI aligned with
human needs.

This course will provide students with practical exposure to the latest AI technologies. Students
will learn the art of prompt engineering, how to use AI as a research, writing and thinking tool,
and strategies to avoid common AI failure points.

The first part of the course will cover how generative AI is created and applied, including the
potential for it to augment human capabilities in beneficial ways. This includes a host of in-class
activities using Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT and other AI tools. This will include workshops on
researching and writing with the help of AI.

The second part of the course will cover societal implications and governance, including public
policy. Issues we will cover include:
● Economic and labor impact: Large generative models can be powerful tools to empower
humans but could also automate many tasks that were previously done by humans,
potentially leading to job loss and disruption in the job market.
● Information and ecosystem impact: Large generative models can be used to help
moderate polarizing conversations, but they can also generate fake information (called
hallucinations) and can be used to create deepfakes, poisoning the information
commons.
● Data ownership impact: AI relies on training data in the form of text, images, and videos
to learn patterns to understand and generate related output. However, open questions
remain on how to compensate content owners and reward the creativity of content
producers in the age of AI.

Class sessions and assignments will involve hands-on AI activities, including the creation of
audio and video “deepfakes” and “red teaming” of models. We will host in-class discussion
groups that dissect AI public policy debates across the US, EU and international realms.

Additionally, we will explore techniques for responsible AI development and release at
organizations.
*Note: AI tools such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot were used to help generate themes to cover in
this course and to find readings, generate activities to support this curriculum, and help edit this syllabus
for clarity.

Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for this class. The course is designed for any graduate student to
experience the latest AI technology and explore its societal implications. It is ideal for students

Class #1 Aug 28: Generative AI Overview, OpenAI onboarding, prompt engineering techniques
The first class will cover the historical backdrop of past technological revolution and societal
consequences for them, setting up the high stakes of steering AI technology to benefit humanity.

After an introduction of how Large Language Models work, we will start using several AI tools to see
how they can be applied in practice and learn prompt engineering techniques to get the models to
provide helpful outputs. We will also consider how to avoid common failure modes.
