# 94-814: Evidence-Based Management

## Course Information

**Units:** 6

## Description

Contemporary managers are heavily swayed in their thinking and decisions by habit, fads, convention and unrealistic levels of confidence. Practitioners of evidence-based management (EBMgt) learn to rethink their approaches to information in order to make more effective decisions. EBMgt means making decisions based on best available evidence with special emphasis on relevant scientific findings, unbiased organizational facts, stakeholder evidence, and professional expertise. It involves active use of decision practices that reduce bias and judgment errors and give due consideration to ethical concerns. This mini course is designed to promote your understanding and use of EBMgt principles. It guides you in developing the skills and knowledge needed to identify, access, and use quality evidence in making better decisions. The instructor is committed to pursuing an evidence-based approach to the course itself. Scientific evidence strongly supports the effectiveness of participation in learning (Ambrose et al., 2010; Tough, 1971). Your success in this course entails actively using evidence-based practices.
