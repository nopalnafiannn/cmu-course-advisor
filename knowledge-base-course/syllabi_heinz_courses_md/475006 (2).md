### Course Description:

This is a medley class that combines SQL (accessing and processing data stored in large,
centralized data stores) and blockchain smart contracts (accessing and processing data stored in
decentralized ledgers). There is significant interest in the industry for both approaches. The course
is designed to provide the student with a serious and hands-on introduction to SQL and smart
contract programming. Applications will primarily be chosen from the area of computational
finance. The student should come to the class with knowledge of at least one programming
language.
### Learning objectives:

By the end of this course, the student will be able to...

1. ... explain the role cryptography and peer-to-peer networks play in securing blockchainbased cryptocurrencies;
2. ... program and deploy smart contracts on an Ethereum test network;
3. ... understand the ERC-20 (fungible token) and ERC721 (non-fungible token) standards;
4. ... understand Automated Market Makers (such as Uniswap V2)
5. ... given an organizational need, identify the data needed to meet the need
6. ... appreciate the foundational ideas of the relational model
7. ... query a database using basic SQL
8. ... apply advanced SQL constructs such as Window Functions and analytic operations such
us ROLLUP, CUBE
## 1. Class Recordings

Recordings of class sessions are covered under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
(FERPA) and must not be shared with anyone outside your course section. The purpose of these
recordings is so students in this course (and only students in this course) can watch or re-watch
past class sessions they have missed due to illness.

### Prerequisites:

We assume that students have a programming course in their background. So, students will
understand the following: syntax errors, logic errors, variables, types, assignment statements,

functions, procedures, parameter passing, conditional expressions, iteration, problem-solving, and
computational thinking.
### Requirements and Grades:

### The assessments will count toward the final grade according to the following distribution:

### *  Assignments: (50% Blockchain, 50% SQL) 42%

### *  Six quizzes (3 on Blockchain, 3 on SQL, the two lowest scores will be dropped): 15%

### *  Two exams (1 on Blockchain, 1 on SQL): 38%

*  Participation and Attendance (5%) You may miss up to two lectures without penalty.
### Good Health:

Take care of yourself: Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well,
exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This
will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful
resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to
ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, dicicult life events, or feelings like
anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological
Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at
http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/
Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to
the support that can help.
