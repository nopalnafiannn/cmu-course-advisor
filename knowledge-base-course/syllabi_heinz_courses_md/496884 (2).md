# Course Description
● Consumer Analytics is a growing field that spans industry boundaries, but is rapidly
evolving within the health care industry. This class delves into the parallel world of
consumer analytics as it pertains to personalization and digital marketing as opposed to
the separate domain of clinical analytics and bioinformatics. Patient utilization history
and claims data are being used to drive wellness health programs, website search
histories are used to under patient behavior better and give recommend at right time.

Healthcare consumers now have more access to information - many companies are
engaged in direct-to-consumer marketing, patients can look up quality outcomes for their
provider, and medication instructional videos are now on YouTube. Held on weekends
for 8 hours per day, this micro mini course will highlight the data sources and insights
used by providers, payers and tech companies to understand and influence consumer
behavior. Students will gain insight into the ML algorithms such as recommendation
engines, marketing analytics, personalization and explore specific use cases alongside
industry experts. Topics will also include evaluation of such technologies and privacy and
ethical implications of collecting and utilizing health data.
● This is an introductory course on US healthcare data and applications of consumer (i.e.
non clinical) analytics. This course will help lay the foundation of your healthcare data
journey and provide you with the knowledge and skills necessary to work in the
healthcare industry as a data analyst/scientist. Healthcare is unique because it is
associated with continually evolving and complex processes associated with health
management and medical care. We'll learn about the many facets to consider in the US
healthcare system and have case study discussions with industry experts along the way.
● We’ll discuss the various types of healthcare data and assess the complexity that occurs
as you work with pulling in all the different types of data to aid in decisions. We'll cover
different categories of healthcare data and describe the terminology / standards to
organize it to facilitate computation. We'll discuss the common clinical representations of
data in healthcare systems, including ICD-10, SNOMED, LOINC, drug vocabularies
(e.g., RxNorm), and clinical data standards. Students will familiarize themselves with the
role of ethics in healthcare analyses and HIPAA Privacy - and unintended consequences
of analytics and discuss the framework to consider the implications.
● We’ll cover the developing trends via disruptive technologies and new data sources and
applications. We’ll discuss case studies with industry leaders and experts.
● We’ll cover the common ML algorithms used in consumer analytics in healthcare and
how to evaluate them
