# 95-891: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

### Spring 2025 schedule (12 units):

### *  Lectures: TTh 5:00 PM - 6:20 PM Eastern, Hamburg Hall 1204 (or on Zoom as indicated

below)
### *  Recitations on every other Friday as indicated below 3:30 PM – 4:50 PM ET, Hamburg Hall

Instructor: David Steier (steier@andrew.cmu.edu )
### Teaching Assistant:

*  Yubo Li (yubol@andrew.cmu.edu)
*  Prince Wang (princewang@cmu.edu)
Driven by the combination of increased access to data, computational power, and improved
sensors and algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are entering the mainstream of
technological innovation. These technologies include machine learning, computer vision, natural
language processing and the emerging area of generative AI.

After an introduction of some basic AI concepts and techniques, the course illustrates both the
potential and current limitations of these techniques with examples from a variety of
applications. We spend some time on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of human
decision-making and learning, specifically in combination with AI systems and on ethical and
policy implications of new AI capabilities. Exercises will include hands-on application of basic
AI techniques as well as selection of appropriate technologies for a given problem and
anticipation of design implications. In a final project, groups of students will participate in the
creation of an AI-based application.

Course Learning Outcomes
### The main learning objectives of the course are to:

## 1. Identify problems where artificial intelligence techniques are applicable

## 2. Apply selected basic AI techniques; judge applicability of more advanced techniques.

## 3. Participate in the design of systems that act intelligently and learn from experience.

Course Prerequisites
This course is primarily aimed at students with technical backgrounds who wish to design and
develop products and services using AI. A background in basic statistics is required for the
course. Students need at least a basic knowledge of Python to complete the assignments for this
course. Students who have not taken 90-812 or 95-888 or have equivalent background will be
required to complete supplementary work to learn Python at the beginning of the course.

### Course Resources and Policies

Canvas and Piazza
An online site with this syllabus, readings, and other resources has been created in Canvas at
<<>>. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the
TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, we encourage you to post
your questions on Piazza. Find our class signup link at <<>> .

Text
The primary reference for the course is Russell, S. & Norvig, P. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern
Approach, Pearson, 2020. This is the fourth edition of the leading textbook in AI, generally
accepted as the most comprehensive reference on the subject. It is a substantial update to the
third edition, so investing in the latest edition is worthwhile, especially if you plan to do further
work in AI. One copy is also available on virtual reserve through the CMU library. This text will
be supplemented by on-line material as listed in the course outline below.

Homework, final projects and grading
There will be 6 homework assignments each due at midnight (Eastern Time) per the following
schedule:
Assignment Due
### 1) Search Feb 1

2) Classification and clustering Feb 22

3) Computer vision Mar 14
4) Natural language Mar 28
### 5) Fairness in AI Apr 10

### 6) Artificial General Intelligence Apr 18

Each assignment will count for 10 percent of the grade, with the lowest grade dropped, for a total
of 50 percent. Late assignments (without a written excuse for medical/family/etc. emergencies)
will be penalized at the rate of 10% of the assignment’s grade per day late. A final project
presentation and report will count for 20 percent of the grade. The final projects are meant to be
done in groups, which should split the work equally and report who did what in the final report.

Three closed-book quizzes on Jan 30, Feb 27, and Apr 2 will count for another 10 percent of the
grade. There is no final exam for this class. The remaining 20 percent will be based on class
attendance and participation in discussions in the lecture sessions (Tuesdays and Thursdays).

Attendance at the recitation sessions (Fridays) is strongly encouraged as helpful information for
the assignments will be presented, but is not mandatory. Two absences are permitted, with
further absences causing a proportional deduction in the class participation grade. When the
course session is in-person, in-person attendance is required for attendance credit, unless there
are medical circumstances requiring remote attendance. When you must miss class, please notify
me (at least 24 hours in advance except for illness/emergency), so that we can discuss alternative
arrangements for catching up on class and associated work. If you encounter extenuating
circumstances and must miss more than two classes, please come and discuss the issue with me;
I would like to find a way to support you.
### Grading will be on a straight scale as follows (with no rounding up):

A+ 98.0-100% B+ 88.0-89.9% C+ 78.0-79.9%
A 92.0-97.9% B 82.0-87.9% C 72.0-77.9%
A- 90.0-91.9% B- 80.0-81.9% C- 70.0-71.9%
Everyone taking the class should register for a letter grade. Auditing the class, or taking the class
Pass/Fail, is intended for extremely rare circumstances and only with consent of the instructor.

Course Outline
This is a full-semester course, planned in general around two lecture sessions per week of 1 hour
20 minutes apiece. Twenty of the lecture sessions will be held in Hamburg Hall 1204, and the
remaining seven sessions will be held on Zoom as indicated below. There will also be five

Academic Integrity
Students are expected to strictly follow Carnegie Mellon University rules of academic integrity
in this course. This means in particular that unless otherwise specified, homework are to be the
work of the individual student using only permitted material and without any cooperation of
other students or third parties. It also means that usage of work by others is only permitted in the
form of quotations and any such quotation must be distinctively marked to enable identification
of the student’s own work and own ideas. All external sources used must be properly cited,
including author name(s), publication title, year of publication, and a complete reference needed
for retrieval. The same work may not be submitted for credit in multiple courses. Violations will
be penalized to the full extent mandated by the CMU policies. There will be no exceptions.

Certain assignments in this course will permit or even encourage the use of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT. When AI use is permissible, it will be clearly stated in
the assignment prompt posted in Canvas. Otherwise, the default is that use of generative AI is
disallowed. In assignments where generative AI tools are allowed, their use must be
appropriately acknowledged and cited. For instance, if you generated the whole document
through ChatGPT and edited it for accuracy, your submitted work would need to include a note
such as “I generated this work through Chat GPT and edited the content for accuracy.”
Paraphrasing or quoting smaller samples of AI generated content must be appropriately
acknowledged and cited, following the guidelines established by the APA Style Guide. It is each
student’s responsibility to assess the validity and applicability of any AI output that is submitted.

You may not earn full credit if inaccurate on invalid information is found in your work.

Deviations from the guidelines above will be considered violations of CMU’s academic integrity
policy. Note that expectations for “plagiarism, cheating, and acceptable assistance” on student
work may vary across your courses and instructors. Please email me if you have questions
regarding what is permissible and not for a particular course or assignment.

Diversity
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this
course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity
that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to
present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and
appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you
personally or for other students or student groups.

Disability Accommodations
If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office,
I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as
possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you
suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet
registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at
access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Mental Health
As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as
strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating
and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your
academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services
are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health
services available on campus at: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Support is always available
(24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412-268-2922.
