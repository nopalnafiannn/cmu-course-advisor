# Spring, 2025: 90-755 Optimization
### Schedule:

## Section A: Tuesday, Thursday 2:00 – 3:20 PM in HbH 2008

## Section B: Tuesday, Thursday 3:30 – 4:50 PM in HbH 2008

Recitation (for both sections): Friday 9:30 – 10:50 AM in A301
Please attend your assigned section. If you have an occasional reason for needing to
attend a different section (e.g., a job interview), let me know but that’s usually fine. If
you have an ongoing reason for needing to switch sections, see me ASAP.

There will be two tests administered during Friday morning recitations on February
14th and February 28th. They are required and make-ups will not be allowed except
under extraordinary circumstances.

All other recitations are optional. In them, I will typically work problems and cases,
stressing managerial interpretation.

Instructor: Jon Caulkins, caulkins@andrew.cmu.edu. Office: HbH 2219
Office Hours: Tuesdays & Thursdays 11:00 – noon & Fridays 11:30 AM – 12:30 PM,
beginning the week of January 20th.
### TA’s:

TBD.

Note: TA’s work specific hours. Outside those hours, they are just students like you, with
their own deadlines and classes to worry about. Do not expect TA’s to be “on duty”
whenever and wherever you see them.

Class Size, Possibility of COVID & Remote format
The Canvas pages give detailed information on what you need to do beforehand to
prepare for class. Historically that was all readings, but now that I have recorded
asynchronous lectures, I sometimes ask you to watch some video so class time can be
“flipped” (more working of problems and discussion).
### Prerequisites:

College pre-calculus or its equivalent, including summation notation and fluency
graphing and interpreting linear and nonlinear functions.

The course uses Excel intensively. If you have not become proficient with Excel
in some other way, you should work through some Excel tutorials before the course begins.
### Course Objectives:

This course is one of several introductory courses in analytics and management science
that survey a variety of hands-on quantitative modeling methods that are useful to decision
makers and business and policy analysts. They overlap considerably, but are tailored for
particular programs based on student career paths and interests. You cannot take courses
from more than one of these sequences because they overlap so much.
*  MSPPM, MS3, and PPM-DC students take two minis: Management Science I and II (90722, 90-760) in spring of Year 1.
### *  PPM-DA & HCAIT students take:

o Optimization (90-755) and Decision & Risk Modeling (90-775) in spring, Year 1.
o Decision Analytics for Business and Policy (94-867) in Year 2.
*  MISM students take one mini: Decision Making Under Uncertainty (95-760).

Students in all three tracks, as well as the Army-BIDA program, are invited to take 94-833
Multicriteria Decision Making & Decision Analysis as an elective, which covers a different
but complementary set of managerial decision tools.

The 90-755/90-775/94-867 sequence has six objectives.

First, you should learn about a variety of management science techniques, what
they are capable of, and what their limitations are so that you can intelligently call upon
specialists and consultants when the occasion arises. (90-755/90-775)
Second, you should become facile at building and analyzing models in both Excel
(90-755/90-775) and advanced software that can handle larger problem instances (94-867).

Third, you should develop skill at writing mathematical equations that represent the
“physics” (operational reality) of systems that you will be responsible for managing and
improving. (All courses in the sequence)
Fourth, you should understand the inner workings of the algorithms that computers
use to solve these equations (“models”) well enough to know which types of problems are
“hard” or “easy” for the computer to solve, what that implies for the “size” problem that
can be handled, and some tricks for transforming “hard” into “easier” problems to solve.
(90-755 & 94-867)
Fifth, you should develop sophistication in your ability to interpret model solutions’
implications for practical managerial decision making. That will be done in 90-755/90775 via small cases, and in 94-867 via larger cases and a term project.

Sixth, you should develop skill at addressing complex, ill-defined, large-scale
decision-making problems that arise in policy and management. This will be done by
learning the theory and analytical toolsets for executing a “data-to-decisions” pipeline in a
principled way. In 94-867, students build on the management science methods learned
from 90-755 and 90-775, along with tools from other Heinz courses (e.g., predictive tools
from machine learning and statistics), to convert data to information (using regression,
neural networks, hybrid mechanistic and ML models) and to embed that information in
optimization models (via contextual optimization, decision-making under uncertainty and
risk, and iterative learning-and-optimization methods such as approximation dynamic
optimization and reinforcement learning). Students will work in Python and utilize a set of
advanced data-to-decision packages (Gurobi, GurobiML, sklearn) to solve large cases.
### Text:

Required: Cliff T. Ragsdale’s Spreadsheet Modeling and Decision Analysis: A Practical
## Introduction to Business Analytics, 9th edition, which you can order from Cengage. You

can get by with the 6th, 7th or 8th editions, although the text does evolve a little and problem
numbering changes, so be careful about that.
### Canvas:

Canvas will be used for distributing materials, posting videos, conducting discussions,
submitting homework and exams, etc. You should monitor it daily.
### Grading:

### Course grades are based on:

Best 4 out of 5 weekly homeworks: 4 X 7 = 28%
Two tests (February 14th and 28th): 30% & 35% = 65%
Attendance & class participation (everyone gets 2 “free” absences to cover all sorts of
exigencies): 7%
### Homework:

I drop one (the lowest) homework grade to allow for all manner of special circumstances
including illness, death in the family, job interviews, etc. You do not need to tell me about
those circumstances; one HW will be dropped regardless. I will not drop more than one
except under truly extraordinary circumstances; usually if someone misses two or more
weeks it is better to take an incomplete and finish the course next year.

Homework can be typed or hand-written, but must be neat. TA’s cannot give points to
things they cannot read. Late assignments will not be accepted and will receive a 0. HW
should be submitted through Canvas’ Gradescope.

HW can be done individually, but I suggest working in groups of two to four (max). Groups
should submit one HW, and everyone in the group will receive the same grade. You do
not need to work with the same people all semester, and groups can have members from
different sections.

There should be minimal interaction across groups concerning homework problems. You
may discuss the readings, concepts, and problems that are not assigned, but you should not
collaborate on the assigned homework problems in any way. Obtaining or providing a
copy of another group’s work, either their answers or a spreadsheet they used, is cheating
and will be subject to sanction up to failure in the course and reporting of the incident to
the Dean for possible expulsion from the College.

If there is a substantial error in grading of a homework, you may ask the TA’s for a regrade. Please do not worry about minor grading issues. Each individual homework
problem counts for a modest portion of the course grade.
### Tests:

File regrade requests via Gradescope (do not ask the TA’s) if there is any error in grading
of your exams. The basic principle is that if what you wrote was correct but was marked
wrong, we want to correct that. It should be obvious, but we cannot award points for wrong
answers even if you “knew how to do it” or it is really important to you to get a higher
grade. (Variations of those arguments were elements of many regrade requests in the past
and they will not be accepted.)
### Attendance & Class participation:

Just as I drop the lowest homework to allow for all manner of special circumstances, I only
expect you to attend 12 of the 14 lectures, and I do not want or need to be told reasons for
absences. If something requires extended absence we can discuss a special
accommodation. But if you just have 3 job interviews or 2 job interviews and 1 cold that
keeps you home on three days, then please just accept that as attending on 11 of the 14
days with associated (very minor) grade loss. I want to incentivize attendance and reward
those with good attendance, but do not want to distract you or me from teaching and
learning with negotiating and documenting things that are not exceptional or extended.

Note: This grade is based on attendance and participation. Attending and saying nothing
in all classes will earn half of the 7 possible points for class participation. At the other
extreme, “cluttering” class with unproductive comments will also be penalized; I expect
thoughtful, active engagement from you as graduate students and professionals.
### Tests:

I do not give make up tests. If you miss a test you can take a 0 on it or take an incomplete
in the course and fill in the score from next year’s test.

Tests start at the beginning of recitation time, and typically will be either 40 60 minutes
long.

Tests are pen and paper tests (closed book, closed notes, one 8.5 X 11” crib sheet, single
sided on the midterm and double sided for the final).
### Academic Integrity:

Cheating will be punished, typically by failure in the course as well as reporting the
infraction to academic action bodies for consideration of further sanctions.
### Taping or Recording Classroom Activities

One section’s classes will be recorded, with a link posted to Canvas.

No student may record or tape any classroom activity without my express written
consent. If a student believes that he/she is disabled and needs to record or tape
classroom activities, he/she should contact the Office of Disability Resources to request
an appropriate accommodation.
### Study Tips:

Watch the assigned videos and read the assigned material before coming to class;
failing to do so is the most common reason people fail the course. Each week covers a
well-defined chunk of material that will be the basis for a homework assignment that is due
the following week. It would be better to submit an incomplete homework than to not
finish the next week’s reading before class
The key to learning math is repeated exposure. It is hard to grasp new concepts from one
or two exposures, no matter how intense. It is more fruitful to work on the material
repeatedly, in small chunks and via different formats (reading the text, listening to lecture,
doing HW, etc.).

Likewise, use active learning. Typically, mathematical material will “make sense” when
you read or hear it, but it is only when you try to use it that you find out whether you’ve
actually learned the material. So, challenge yourself to work additional problems, explain
concepts to friends or family members, and think about how you would apply the material
outside the classroom.

Related: This material is mathematical, and I demand a high degree of clarity and precision
in articulating concepts. If you broadly understand something but give a vague or
imprecise answer, that will not receive credit.

Lecture is a terrible time to try to learn Excel mechanics. I will demonstrate things in Excel
to give you a big picture understanding of what can be done. However, your primary
resources for learning Excel will be the textbook and online aids. If you Google or search
on YouTube you’ll find lots of excellent Excel guides.
(Do not expect TA’s to debug your spreadsheets. They may be able to help explain Excel
techniques if there are no other students with conceptual or mathematical questions. But,
the textbook and online tutorials are your primary source for Excel help.)
