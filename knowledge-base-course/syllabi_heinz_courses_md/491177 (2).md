Course Description
We have entered the era of Generative AI, which holds transformational potential akin to the
industrial revolution or the advent of the Internet. This technology is now capable of
comprehending and generating language, code, images, and videos, performing routine digital
tasks, and aiding humans in advancing scientific and creative fields.

These intelligent capabilities are powering novel AI user experiences such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT,
Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot and other proprietary and open-source offerings. These
innovations can boost human productivity and creativity, but their impact on society is
unpredictable long-term. By immersing ourselves in the study of Generative AI, we not only
equip ourselves for personal growth but also become architects of a future where we can help
steer technology to serve humanity’s highest aspirations.

This course explores the broad impacts of generative AI by considering its applications, societal
implications, and how organization can govern its usage. We will explore how leveraging AI
tools can help us as individuals thrive in our personal and professional lives. We will learn how
both governments and private enterprises are seeking to develop beneficial and safe AI aligned
with human needs.

This course will provide students with practical exposure to the latest AI technologies. Students
will learn the art of prompt engineering, how to use AI as a research, writing and thinking tool,
and strategies to avoid common AI failure points.

The first part of the course will cover how generative AI is created and applied, including the
potential for it to augment human capabilities in beneficial ways. This includes a host of in-class
activities using Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT and other AI tools. This will include workshops on
researching and writing with the help of AI.

The second part of the course will cover societal implications and governance, including public
policy. Issues we will cover include:
● Economic and labor impact: Large generative models can be powerful tools to empower
humans but could also automate many tasks that were previously done by humans,
potentially leading to job loss and disruption in the job market.
● Information and ecosystem impact: Large generative models can be used to help
moderate polarizing conversations, but they can also generate fake information (called
hallucinations) and can be used to create deepfakes, poisoning the information
commons.
● Data ownership impact: AI relies on training data in the form of text, images, and videos
to learn patterns to understand and generate related output. However, open questions
remain on how to compensate content owners and reward the creativity of content
producers in the age of AI.

Class sessions and assignments will involve hands-on AI activities, including the creation of
audio and video “deepfakes” and “red teaming” of models. We will host in-class discussion
groups that dissect AI public policy debates across the US, EU and international realms.

Additionally, we will explore techniques for responsible AI development and release at
organizations.
*Note: AI tools such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot were used to help generate themes to cover in
this course and to find readings, generate activities to support this curriculum, and help edit this syllabus
for clarity.

models are developed, including the data inputs and the stages of training and development. We will
then cover how these base models can be integrated into more sophisticated software applications
and learn how to use several of these more advanced applications. Finally, we will see
demonstrations of the most cutting-edge applications using Generative AI and begin to imagine how
these technologies might impact society.
