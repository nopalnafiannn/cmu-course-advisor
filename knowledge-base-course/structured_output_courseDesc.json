As your textbook authors say, the purpose of econometrics is to “untangle cause and effect in human affairs.” Econometrics is essential for advancing understanding in the social sciences, conducting public policy evaluation, and assessing the impact of business practice. Both Applied Econometrics I and Applied Econometrics II are “hands on” courses in which you will not only learn to read and interpret existing studies, but will also conduct econometric analyses of your own. The goal is to help you take your first few steps toward becoming a “Metrics Master”! One of those steps is becoming competent and confident in the use of Stata to conduct empirical analyses."

This course is an experiment in improving public policy by working outside the traditional structures of government. Students will be working with external partners to investigate real problem spaces and building policy-driven prototypes driven by user research. Students will work to solve pressing challenges by redefining the problem in terms of understanding the affected users of systems, conducting user-centered research, designing solutions, testing those same solutions, and iteratively improving those outcomes. This course is designed to take advantage of recent lessons learned in applied innovation in government entities around the world. The actual outcomes will be heavily dependent on both the needs of the problem sets for each course as well as the skills of the students. The course will apply some methodologies commonplace in industry like agile, design-thinking, and prototyping to deliver open source products and services that have the potential to live on beyond the course. For public-facing projects, work will be done in a transparent manner where possible in order to encourage external participation. Students will be expected to embrace a culture that expects and encourages rapid iteration, express a willingness to fail early in order to discover a solution that ultimately works, and a flat structure that provides students with an opportunity to deliver for our government partners."

      },
      "Description": "Companies, governments, and other organizations now collect massive amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video. How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights? A common problem is that we often do not know what structure underlies the data ahead of time, hence the data often being referred to as “unstructured”. This course takes a practical approach to unstructured data analysis via a two-step approach: We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this structure to make predictions. Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations. Along the way, we encounter many of the most popular methods in analyzing unstructured data, from modern classics in manifold learning, clustering, and topic modeling to some of the latest developments in deep neural networks for analyzing text, images, and time series, including going over basics of large language models. We will be coding lots of Python and dabble a bit with GPU computing (Google Colab). Note regarding GenAI and foundation models (such as large language models): As likely all of you are aware, there are now technologies like (Chat)GPT, Gemini, Claude, Llama, etc which will all be getting better over time. If you use any of these in your homework, please cite them. For the purposes of the class, I will view these as external collaborators/resources. For exams, I want to make sure that you actually understand the material and are not just telling me what someone else or GPT/Gemini/etc knows. This is important so that in the future, if you use AI technologies to assist you in your data analysis, you have enough background knowledge to check for yourself whether you think the AI is giving you a solution that is correct or not. For this reason, exams in this class will explicitly not allow electronics."

      "Description": "The purpose of Public Finance (90-736/90-435) is to provide an introduction to the theory and practice of how national, regional and local governments should and actually finance their budgets for operating and capital project purposes. To accomplish this, the course reviews: i] rationales for government intervention in the market place, ii] analyzes methods of resolving conflicts over the size of the public sector budget, iii] extensively analyzes the rationales and issues of various types of tax revenue, and iv] reviews the effects of public sector spending and taxes on the aggregate economy. Throughout, Public Finance emphasizes the interplay between how current revenue policy is fashioned, and how the models and their key assumptions along with political processes interact which result in changes in current law at the federal, state, and local levels. While the examples are largely drawn from the United States, examples are also drawn from around the world. Because the subject matter of public spending and revenues can easily consume an entire academic year of study, Public Finance focuses mainly on the revenue side of the public budget. Two courses typically offered by Professor Strauss in the Spring build on Public Finance. Public Expenditure Analysis (90-774/90-474) deals with techniques for evaluating private and public expenditure and capital spending decisions. Education Finance and Policy (90-817) deals in-depth with issues surrounding multi-level government finance from US and international perspectives. Public Finance is taught in lecture/discussion format with an emphasis on developing each student’s analytical reasoning skills. Original course lecture outlines in .doc format are maintained in Canvas, along with working Excel examples used in class, and assigned and optional readings. While Public Finance and Public Expenditure Analysis are self-contained, students who have had a semester of statistics and a semester of micro-economics at the principles or Advanced Placement levels will be more comfortable. Evaluation of student performance is based on evaluation of short-essay midterms and final exams, problem sets and class participation. Students may drop the lowest midterm and problem set grade. For more information about Professor Strauss and this course, see respectively: www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rs9f under Teaching for the current course outline."

      "Description": "Empirical research is most valuable when it uses data to answer specific causal questions, as if in a randomized clinical trial. In the absence of a real experiment, we look for well-controlled comparisons and/or natural quasi-experiments. Some research designs are more convincing than others, but the econometric methods behind them are almost always fairly simple. This course provides an introduction to the most important items in an applied econometrician’s toolkit: (i) analysis of randomized controlled trials; (ii) regression models designed to control for variables that may mask the causal effects of interest; (iii) difference-in-differences-type strategies that use repeated observations to control for unobserved omitted factors; and (iv) instrumental variables and regression discontinuity methods for the analysis of real and natural experiments. In this course, emphasis will be given to conceptual issues and statistical techniques that turn up in the applied research we read and do. Many empirical examples will illustrate these ideas and techniques. Within the Heinz College, 90-906 is appropriate for first-year PhD students plus first and second year Masters students who desire and are prepared for a rigorous course in econometrics as a base for more advanced research methodology. Outside the Heinz school, 90-906 may be of interest to graduate students in Engineering and Public Policy, Social and Decision Science, Software Engineering, Psychology, GSIA, Philosophy, Applied History, or Architecture who need background in econometrics targeted toward social and policy research."

      "Description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries by driving innovation, improving efficiency, and enhancing decision-making processes. Yet, despite its potential, many AI projects face significant hurdles in deployment. According to a recent survey, only 22% of data scientists report that their \"revolutionary\" AI initiatives—those designed to enable new processes or capabilities—usually reach deployment. Alarmingly, 43% say that 80% or more of their AI projects fail to make it into production. Even when considering all types of machine learning projects, including those focused on refreshing existing models, only 32% of models typically deploy. These statistics underscore the critical challenges of scaling AI systems effectively. This course is designed to tackle these challenges head-on, providing graduate-level students with a comprehensive understanding of the AI lifecycle. Students will learn how to navigate the complex process of identifying which business tasks should be automated through AI and which decisions should be augmented using AI. The course introduces practical frameworks essential for making these strategic decisions and successfully implementing AI solutions. Throughout the course, students will engage deeply with each stage of the AI lifecycle. They will learn to identify and prioritize high-impact AI use cases, conduct thorough cost-benefit analyses, and design strategic roadmaps aimed at maximizing return on investment (ROI). The curriculum blends theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience using industry-standard tools such as Jupyter Lab, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, and Evidently. These tools are critical for overcoming the common pitfalls associated with AI deployment and preparing students to scale AI systems in real-world environments. The course’s practical orientation is further enhanced through case studies that serve as a foundation for class discussions. These case studies provide students with the opportunity to analyze real-world AI applications, assess the challenges involved, and understand the decision-making processes behind successful implementations. Additionally, two guest lectures from seasoned industry practitioners will offer firsthand insights into the practical challenges of AI deployment across various sectors. A strong emphasis is placed on governance and trust, equipping students with the knowledge to develop ethical, transparent, and effective AI systems. Students will learn how to integrate AI into organizational processes, assess talent and skill gaps, and create strategies to build the necessary capabilities for sustained AI-driven innovation. This course is essential for students aspiring to careers as AI engineers, AI analysts, or AI governance experts. It is equally invaluable for business and technology students who wish to understand how to manage the development and deployment of AI systems. By the end of the course, students will possess a well-rounded, practical understanding of AI system management, enabling them to lead AI-driven projects and drive innovation across industries."

      "Description": "After decades of slow wage growth and rising inequality, many American workers now fear an epidemic of joblessness as new technologies increasingly replace human labor. Is this likely to occur? How will emerging technologies reshape the U.S. labor market? How important is the “gig economy,” and how big might it become? What impact will the shocks generated by the COVID crisis and rising inflation have on employment and income inequality in the short run and the long run? What can policy makers do to ensure that the growth of the American economy is more inclusive and equitable? The curriculum of 90-745 has been rewritten to help Heinz students (and other interested CMU students) think seriously and rigorously about the future of work in the 21st century American economy. The course will place current concerns in the broader context of the major structural shifts in the U.S. labor market over the past several decades. Drawing upon the most recent quantitative analyses, the course will show that technological change has contributed to increasingly unequal outcomes in the U.S. labor market for decades, and that this trend is likely to continue as a new wave of technological change unfolds. The course will also consider the degree to which globalization, immigration, rising monopoly power, declining union strength, minimum wage laws, and discrimination based on race and gender have contributed to rising inequality in U.S. incomes. The course will draw upon frontier research to identify old and new policy ideas that could help make economic growth more inclusive, and it will bring into the classroom policy entrepreneurs who are making a real difference. The course instructor, Professor Lee Branstetter, is a globally recognized expert on the economics of innovation and technological change. He co-leads the Future of Work research initiative within Carnegie Mellon’s Block Center for Technology and Society. In 2011-2012, Professor Branstetter served on the staff of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. Students enrolling in this course will have two options for grading and evaluation. Under the first option, grades will be based on a midterm, final exam, and a series of short policy essays. Under the second option, grades will be primarily based on a systems synthesis project linked to the course, through which students will be able to undertake original policy analysis for an external client on a project related to the themes of the course. Students should check the uploaded provisional syllabus for potential systems projects."

NOTE: M1/M2/M3/M4-based Apple Silicon Macs are not supported for this class. Most Macs sold since early 2021 have this incompatible chip. You can check yours via Apple menu -> About This Mac, then look at the Chip/Processor line.There are no workarounds, and Heinz does not provide any physical or virtual systems that can be used for this class. Students who register and have only an M* Mac will have to acquire an Intel/AMD-based computer to use, or drop the course. It doesn't have to be your school laptop though, it could be a spare older laptop or desktop with at least 8GB of RAM and and SSD drive, and that is still supported by current Windows or MacOS releases. Adequate used laptops are available for well under $200. You could think of it as an expensive textbook. Something like this $109 example from ebay would be just fine: https://www.ebay.com/itm/266857047723. Minimal specs are Intel or AMD dual-core CPU, 8GB RAM, 200+GB SSD (not spinning disk) storage. Make sure the listing includes Windows Pro 10/11 OS (not Windows Home) and a charger. Dell's model numbering for Latitudes can be confusing, you can check the model numbers at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Latitude to see how old it is.\",\n    \"Syllabus Links\": [\n      \"https://api-01.heinz.cmu.edu/syllabus/vwsyllabus/509511\",\n      \"https://api-01.heinz.cmu.edu/syllabus/vwsyllabus/422797\"\n    ],\n    \"Metadata\": {\n      \"Course Number\": \"95-799\",\n      \"Title\": \"Linux and Open Source\",\n      \"Units\": \"6\",\n      \"Key Terms\": \"Emphasis is on how Linux is different from other systems, related applications, Note example syllabus may be from online or on, Mini, Open Source Software, Topics and general structure are the same, This course covers the Linux operating system\"\n    }\n  }\n}",

      "Description": "When is making a change to a webpage, an algorithm, or products worthwhile? Should I increase or decrease prices? Is my advertising cost-effective? Rather than simply relying on the intuition of managers, businesses increasingly strive to accurately identify the impact of their actions. This is particularly the case in the digital economy where firms have access too large amounts of data. However, properly identifying the causal effect of a business change requires knowledge of the appropriate methods. One such methods is to conduct field experiments, also referred to as A/B tests. Yet, implementing experiments is not always straightforward but instead requires a thorough understanding of both the underlying business problem as well as the challenges associated with the identification of causal effects. This class teaches methods for measuring the true impact of business changes in the digital economy. Because of the prevalence of A/B testing in practices, we especially emphasize how A/B tests work and how to apply them. We will have hands-on discussions of how managers can measure impact in business situations and how to evaluate claims of impact made by others. While the focus will lie on A/B testing, we will also discuss other methods that can be used when experiments are not feasible. Methods are illustrated with examples from a variety of digital businesses including Microsoft, Amazon, eBay and Uber. We will cover examples in a variety of topical areas including advertising, pricing, product design and distribution channel decisions. Guest speakers will discuss the practical importance and challenges of implementing A/B as well as what firms can do when implementing straight-forward A/B tests is not practical."

Management Science I: Optimization) by addressing three additional topics in managerial decision making: MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making) Decision Analysis Decision processes MCDM is a collection of methods for trading-off different alternatives’ performance on multiple conflicting objectives; methods discussed include weighted sum scoring models, swing weights, TOPSIS, DEA, AHP, and rank-based methods. Decision Analysis is the prescriptive model for rationally maximizing subjective expected utility in the face of uncertainty; it is particularly powerful for dealing with sequential decisions, quantifying the value of information, assessing and incorporating subjective probabilities, and doing Bayesian updates of probabilities as new information becomes available. Decision process considerations go beyond the paradigm of a single well-defined decision maker and mathematical method. Potential topics we could cover include industrial analytics, auctions, composite indicators (“US News & World Report” style ratings), balanced scorecards, “dashboards” of key performance indicators, group processes, and matching a decision method to the circumstances at hand."

The course provides a lens into the nexus of institution-artist-audience within a framework of mission-impact and ROI. This course provides students with both the fundamentals and the emerging practices within arts enterprises. The course also creates a foundation for subsequent, advanced coursework. Students will encounter the economic and sociologic theories necessary to understand for profit and nonprofit enterprises. These theories become grounded by engaging in real-life experience, case studies, and course-exercises. The course is organized in 5 modules: Introduction / Frameworks; Public Policy/Cultural Policy; Business Structures; Governance & Leadership; Business Strategies & Strategic Planning For the purpose of this course, arts enterprises will be defined as those that create relationships between artists and audiences. Arts enterprises include, but are not limited to: orchestras, opera companies, music ensembles, museums, arts centers, theatre companies, presenting organizations, multi-media centers, artist agencies, galleries, media and dance companies."

      "Description": "The performing arts industry has had a varied and lively history in the United States for the last 175 years (essentially once train travel allowed for broad distribution of artists across the nation) with pivotal transformation beginning in 2020 – 2021 due to social upheaval and the global pandemic. While the field is divided into for – profit and non-profit models with the need to pay the bills a recurring, common - denominator. This course focuses on the performing arts set within a (mostly) nonprofit landscape in which organizations produce and/or present works to transform audiences and serve their community via one or several intersecting art forms. Producing or presenting a successful season entails selection (planning) and implementation (managing) of programs, something that is neither easy nor consistent. Driving and complicating the situation is the common bifurcated management structure. Managers must find a way to implement the vision of an Artistic Director or other titled Artistic leader – an individual with an aesthetic and social framework that shapes an institution and its artistic offerings. Arts managers enable this artistic vision within the context of the physical, geographical, financial, and human constraints of a specific company. Combining and mixing these forces is frequently messy and always an adventure. Organizational history, indeed the history of the art form itself, often provides vexing constraints and practices to the process that must be dismantled to meet the demands of a socially just, 21st-century model. If a career of ‘doing the same thing’ is the goal, then a different field might be recommended. This course will examine approaches to producing a performing arts season of programming with an emphasis on the nonprofit season structure that meets the demands of a post-Covid-19 pandemic, digital-forward, anti-racist reality. Over 7 short weeks, we will attempt to answer the following question: How do artistic and managerial leaders move an organization and its mission through an equitable artistic vision set across a selection of programs while maintaining or creating a holistic system to manage the process and evaluate artistic success, community impact, and mission-centric strategic goals? All this while balancing the technological realities of contemporary existence. The course is a seminar. It is designed to engage your critical thinking. Reading material, watching videos, and attending performances are required. Readings will include books, excerpts, workbooks and articles on planning, management models, and styles. The frameworks for the unique qualities of the panoply of performing arts programs (season planning, education programs, etc) are our topic but within the setting and requirements of individual disciplines. The course will focus on Greater Pittsburgh (Allegheny County) – as a case study and playground but the USA offers useful examples for you to bring to the course as well.",

      "Description": "95-771 is a one-semester, 12-unit course which covers the fundamental data structures and algorithms for information processing. The course uses the Java programming language to illustrate the concepts covered; students are expected to code their assignments in Java. Students enrolled in the course must have a prior background in programming (course work or practical experience). Students with an adequate grasp of programming should have little difficulty learning the Java constructs required to do their assignments. It should be noted that this is not a Java programming course. With the exception of some initial background information, the course does not focus on the Java language itself, and students who have not studied Java are responsible for acquiring any additional required skills outside of class. Students without adequate programming preparation should consider taking an additional programming course as a pre-requisite or co-requisite to this course. A major part of the course focuses on the design and analysis of data structures and their algorithms. Therefore, we will not be using the built-in Java classes that provide immediate access to such data structures. Who Should Take This Course? MSIT and MISM students: Required course for the Concentration in Strategic Information Processing and the Concentration in Medical Informatics. SCS & LTI MS students: Optional course for students who desire a hands-on programming course in algorithms and data structures. See your advisor."

      "Description": "For most of the past 40 years, no region of the world has been more economically dynamic than Asia. This economic growth transformed the patterns of world trade, lifted millions out of absolute poverty, and so captivated the attention of Western economists and business leaders that it was commonplace by the early 1990s to refer to the economic achievements of these countries as the “East Asian miracle.” The nature of this apparent miracle changed dramatically over the course of the 1990s as the most advanced economy in the region, Japan, suffered a sharp growth slowdown, and a number of the other \"miracle\" economies were engulfed in a regional economic crisis in the latter half of the decade. These events highlighted weaknesses in the East Asian growth model that had been hidden during the boom years. Despite these economic problems, accelerating growth in the world's most populous countries, China and India, helped sustain regional progress and kept global attention focused on economic growth in Asia through the 2000s and 2010s, even though the growth and the international attention were largely concentrated in a different set of countries. However, new worries about Chinese economic growth have emerged in recent years. Is China's growth miracle slowing down? How does the economic history of Asia's more advanced economies inform our view of the future economic prospects for India and China? In what ways are China and India pursuing a different path to economic development than that taken by their predecessors? The United States has long played an important role in Asia as an investor, customer, and key ally of important nations in the region. How will the policies of the Biden Administration shape these important relationships and the future evolution of the region? We will seek to address all of these questions."

Economics provides a theoretical foundation for the allocation of scarce resources, but in practice, there are a variety of challenges in measuring benefits and costs in quantitative and monetary terms. Such challenges include determining how to value benefits and costs experienced in the future, reductions in the risk of premature death and injury, and the distribution of these impacts among affected populations, as well as appropriately characterizing uncertainty. The ability to assess key assumptions and limitations is critical for both producers and consumers of cost-benefit analysis."

      "Description": "In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly approved The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which establish an ambitious set of goals for achieving development progress in a prescribed time frame. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent the latest effort by the international community to encourage and facilitate broad-based progress across multiple sectors in individual countries. But unlike in the past, the SDGs include social justice goals, climate-related commitments, a true focus on gender equality, and a commitment for all nations - not just those considered 'developing countries' - to address sustainable development issues domestically. The SDGs have also opened the space for innovation, including a robust effort by regional authorities, city governments, and even institutions such as Carnegie Mellon University to adopt the Goals as a framework for expressing and planning around sustainable development commitments. The SDGs highlight the tremendous progress in improving the quality of human life that has been made during the past 200 years, and in particular since the end of World War II. Building on this record, achieving the SDGs will mark a notable step forward in addressing the most serious inequities that exist across the globe, including extreme poverty, food insecurity, illiteracy, and inadequate health care. However, pessimists worry about the enormous challenges currently confronting the international community, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. They note that by 2050 global population will reach 9.6 billion people. To feed an increasingly affluent number of people, we will need 70 percent more food production and a doubling of available water and arable land, which will come at the expense of existing natural systems. Additionally, the growing geopolitical tensions between the United States and China complicate efforts to achieve a global consensus on these challenges. For Americans, the SDGs provide a useful vocabulary and broader perspective for considering contemporary political, economic, and societal trends. In contrast to the history of American exceptionalism, the SDGs demonstrate the myriad ways that the United States is part of a global community. This course prepares CMU students to help shape the future of the planet, improve one's arguments in favor of sustainable development, and link up effectively with other leaders who are engaged in these efforts."

It has applications that range from managing potentially hazardous technologies, to involving patients more fully in the choice of medical procedures, to the design of computer-interactive systems. The course covers behavioral theories of probabilistic inference, intuitive prediction, preference, and decision making. Topics include heuristics and biases in inference and prediction, risk perceptions and attitudes, strategies for combining information from different sources and dealing with conflicting objectives, and the roles of group and emotional processes in decision making.

      "Description": "Pre-Requisite(s): 90-711 or 90-777. In all parts of the world, from the local to the global level, governments, funding agencies, organizations, and individuals are involved in activities meant to improve some aspect of people’s lives – disaster relief in Haiti, human rights work in Sierra Leone, increasing school attendance in Detroit or improving outcomes for IV drug users in Barcelona, the list is long and ever changing. The needs addressed by these programs are often compelling and the programs themselves can be innovative, practical, and inspired. From those running and funding social programs to those whose needs are meant to be addressed by these programs a central question arises: Does this social program work? In this course you will learn how to gather and synthesize evidence to address this question. Program evaluation is the systematic application of social science methods to assess each aspect of a program: the need for the program, the program's design and implementation, and ultimately the program’s impact on relevant outcomes. A completed program evaluation results in (1) information regarding the program’s merit, worth, or significance, (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (3) the implications of both (1) and (2) for decision making. Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading. This course is designed to familiarize the student with the central concepts and methods of program evaluation. Students will be taught how to conduct basic program evaluations as well as how to critique and monitor more comprehensive program evaluations. Successful completion of this course will prepare students to be contributing members of teams that design and carry out program evaluations or that commission program evaluations and make decisions based upon their results.",

      "Description": "Overview. The purpose of this Heinz public policy course is to introduce professional master’s students to the special problems of financing regional governments in a decentralized federal system with a special focus on k-12 education. As a public policy course it characterizes from different vantage points the salient features of current k-12 education finance and related issues, identifies areas where there are various ideas of how to improve or promote change, and reviews the underlying methodologies with numerous examples of how to both justify and implement such changes in education finance and policy. The course is unusual in that it emphasizes both the constitutional and legal aspects of school finance and policy and draws together through problem sets and in class examples of the use actual school finance data maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Also relevancy of the course is maintained via the instructor’s ongoing research in education finance and periodic involvement with the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania General Assembly, the school districts of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on matters of school finance, teacher recruitment and retention and student achievement. [See http://paeducationquality.net/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP8a2VYqPcQ] The course reviews theories of federalism from economic and constitutional perspectives, reviews the evolution of the United States from a confederation to a federation, examines financial and political problems associated with jointure, reviews alternative rationales for public financing and provision of education (k-16), distressed school systems and municipal governments, distributional effects of k-16 public education, the use of cost-effectiveness and educational production functions, school budgeting issues, the school property tax, school segregation (by race) in the US, intergovernmental relations and the design of school aid formulas, the measurement and implications of student achievement, teacher preparation and selection, and school governance issues. These issues are examined from positive and normative perspectives, and through the lens of economics and political economy. Class discussion examples will be drawn not only from Pennsylvania, but from other states, and internationally. [1] Thanks to Christine Alagara for pointing this out in class some years ago.

      "Description": "The success of arts and cultural institutions in the 21st century and beyond will depend upon creative, unconventional and coordinated long-range approaches to communicating with their stakeholders. This is even more true as organizations continue through and emerge from the circumstances of the global pandemic. Communication is a core activity of any arts enterprise. External Relations frames and holds together the brand of all stakeholder communications across earned and contributed income streams (marketing = earned; development = contributed). Today’s communication professionals are crucial to their arts organizations; they maintain existing audiences, secure new audiences, create future donors, and create the brand for the institution. They interact with all aspects of the organization, from personnel to fundraising. This course provides readings and professional presentations to guide the understanding of successful marketing and communication. From an understanding of this thought leadership, students engage in a project-based method to investigate hands-on the opportunities addressing the changes within the arts audience and the shifting digital landscape for marketing the arts in the United States. The focus of the course is marketing and communications within a nonprofit arts organization, recognizing that the audiences rarely distinguish the difference. Yet, due to budget AND purpose, marketing not-for-profit arts organizations is significantly different as compared to a for-profit entertainment venture. This course will provide each student with marketing principles and theories, as well as opportunities to actualize theories with assignments and a final project utilizing current technologies. The course requires active, practical engagement and intellectual rigor."

      "Description": "The first day of the new Trump Administration will be January 20th, and as you know, a common benchmark of every new administration is a look at what they accomplish in the first 100 days. This class will work together to understand the reality of the policy ecosystem, tracking, and analyzing policy proposals and actions as they are introduced in real-time! President Trump promises to shake things up. The Department of Government Efficiency is targeting cuts of $2 Trillion! Think tanks are producing policy papers with recommendations, nonprofits are positioning themselves to fight for their causes, and government agencies are waiting to learn the administration’s plans. Will the Department of Education be eliminated? Will the new administration consolidate all the financial regulatory agencies into one? Will all foreign assistance be deleted? This class is being designed to provide context and a framework for analyzing the first 100 days of the new administration’s policies. We will be learning about policy, where ideas come from, who the players are, and how policies get executed. We will be producing quick turn-around policy memos exactly as if we were employed by a member of Congress, or working in a policy shop in a Federal, State, or local agency, or working in a non-profit association or private sector think tank. When the executive orders and legislative proposals are released, we will be analyzing them along with everyone else. Policy analysis in real-time! Karl Maschino is the Distinguished Service Professor of Public Policy and Management Mr. Maschino previously served as the Chief Financial and Administrative Officer and Co-Chief Risk Officer of the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) from 2014 to 2024, leading agency operations, including information technology, finance, budget, human capital, training, labor relations, facility management, security, field operations and enterprise risk management for an agency of approximately 3,500 staff, with locations in Washington, D.C., and in 11 field offices around the country. Prior to GAO, Mr. Maschino worked at the U.S. Department of Justice, starting as a Budget Analyst (Presidential Management Fellow) with the Justice Management Division, then moving to the Criminal Division, where he worked in several progressively responsible positions, before his career appointment in the Senior Executive Service as the Division’s Executive Officer. While at the Justice Department he served detail assignments as the Appropriations Liaison Officer for the Department, and as a Program Examiner at the Office of Management and Budget, International Affairs Branch. His first position in the federal government was as an intern for Representative Lee Hamilton. Prior to government service, Mr. Maschino worked in the fields of sustainable economic development, and international higher education in university, city government, and nonprofit settings, including as a Program Officer for The Asia Foundation in San Francisco, CA before attending Heinz College. Mr. Maschino is a graduate of the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University (M.P.M.), the McIntire School at the University of Virginia (M.S.

Using these three skills, students will practice understanding and critiquing policy research. Moreover, by identifying and understanding potential problems, students can make valid conclusions even from seriously flawed research. At the end of the class, students demonstrate these skills by independently evaluating an existing piece of research of their choice, presenting their findings in a written report and in-class presentation."

Information technology managers, directors, and CIO/CTO's, once looked upon as the enablers of integrating and maintaining business technologies, are increasingly seen as the driving force behind creating and sustaining competitive advantage through information technology innovation. To succeed in this environment, the IT leader must have a grounded understanding of the technology in use, the potential development for new technology, and the ability to strategize and understand the impacts of incorporating technology in the business or industry they serve. This class will focus on two main areas to help IT leaders succeed: managing the business side of the entity including its people and processes; and managing the technical roles, innovations and implications for the digital business. From a business context, the course will focus on digital business models including eCommerce marketplaces, requirements elicitation for understanding and establishing the needs of internal and external stakeholders, understanding the roles of fulfillment in the current business environment, understanding the difference between SCM and ERP systems to determine advantages and disadvantages of each, and understanding the workings of B2B and P2P markets. From a technical context, this course will focus on current and emerging immersive technologies such as IoT, ePayment, Blockchain, Intelligent Automation, and Cloud & Quantum Computing.

Moreover, national news organizations and the popular press deliver the results from their latest surveys on a daily basis. To what extent can you trust the results? Are the survey results flawed by inappropriate survey design and methods? This course introduces you to a set of principles and methods in survey design that are based on the scholarship that informs best practices in the field. We will use the concept of total survey error to frame an understanding of the key issues in survey research, including sampling frames, survey statistics, modes of data collection, non-response, question structure, wording, context and other important features of survey administration and data collection. By developing your own survey, you will examine the major decisions faced by a professional who wants to design and administer high-quality surveys. The course will focus heavily on class discussion of readings, in-class group work, and a survey design project. For this reason, attendance and active participation are important for successful learning in this course."

      "Description": "This public policy course provides a systematic framework, capital budgeting, for the evaluation of private-sector projects and also public sector projects; the latter builds on the former, and introduces issues of externalities, interdependencies between primary and secondary markets for goods and services, and the social rate of discount. Two courses, Public Finance, taught in the Fall by Professor Robert Strauss, and Cost-Benefit Analysis: A Capital Budgeting Approach taught in the Spring by Professor Robert Strauss, may be viewed as providing a conceptual and practical framework for those Heinz students seeking careers in the public sector, or those parts of the private sector that routinely deal with the public sector. This course strengthens each student's ability to compare resources devoted to providing current capital projects, and those proposed to new capital projects to understand how various stakeholders both pay for and receive benefits from them over time The course is divided into 3 modules. In Module 1 (weeks 1 - 4), the course develops the essential techniques of private sector evaluation principles with a focus on long-lived capital projects and how such projects are typically financed through retained earnings, and bond and stock markets. In Module 2 (weeks 5 - 6), special problems which arise in the evaluation of public sector projects are discussed; a variety of evaluation techniques and applications especially suited to public sector projects are then examined. In Module 3 (week 7), actual cost-benefit studies in the policy areas of sports stadiums, elderly driving, and education, are examined."

      "Description": "The ability to secure information within a modern enterprise is a growing challenge. Threats to information security are global, persistent, and increasingly sophisticated. Long gone are the days when managers could hope to secure the enterprise through ad hoc means. Effective information security at the enterprise level requires participation, planning, and practice. Fortunately, the information security community has developed a variety of resources, methods, and best practices to help modern enterprises address the challenge. However, employing these tools demands a high degree of commitment, understanding, and skill—attributes that must be sustained through constant awareness and training. An essential part of the information security plan is cyber security policy – this includes the written plans for how the enterprise IT assets will be protected. This course provides students with information on the origin of cyber security policy, governance structures for policy creation, selection and implementation of policy, and audit and control functions to ensure compliance and efficacy. Students will be exposed to the national and international policy and legal considerations related to cybersecurity and cyberspace such as privacy, intellectual property, cybercrime, homeland security (i.e., critical infrastructure protection) and cyberwarfare, and the organizations involved in the formulation of such policies. Broader technology issues also are discussed to demonstrate the interdisciplinary influences and concerns that must be addressed in developing or implementing effective national cybersecurity laws and policies."

      "Description": "This course is taught with asynchronous video lectures and readings with in-person and remote office hours. A geographic information system (GIS) provides an effective way to visualize, organize and manage a wide variety of information including administrative and medical record data, environmental health, social services, and other location data. Public health departments, hospitals, and medical research agencies are using GIS to map health-related events, identify disease clusters, investigate environmental health problems, and understand the spread of disease. This course uses a unique approach for teaching GIS in health care. It involves learning how to use GIS software in the context of carrying out projects for visualizing and analyzing health-related data. Each week includes lectures and computer labs that focus on a health, technical, or policy issue which use Esri's ArcGIS Pro and Platform technologies to analyze data or solve a problem. Students learn to create Story Maps and Dashboards to convey their maps and associated text to the public and decision makers. Through assignments and projects students will not only learn how to use the software but will also learn the many distinctive advantages of using GIS for health care policy making and planning. By the end of the course, students will have sufficient background so that they can become expert users of GIS in health organizations - building, managing, and using GIS maps and health data.

      "Description": "This course will meet April 5 & 6, 2025 at the Heinz College Washington DC campus. Students are expected to attend in person. This “micro-mini” course serves as an introduction to global health security and its intricate links to international relations and international development. As societies and economies are increasingly interconnected and thus interdependent, new forms of health security threats are arising, and nations are investing more in mutual preparedness and are conducting new forms of “soft power” diplomacy to mitigate those risks. In recent years, the realm of health security has expanded greatly with more governments, companies, and NGOs working to address both nascent and persistent threats. Over an immersive weekend of overview and interaction, this micro-mini highlights prominent threat categories, namely the “3-D threats” of Disaster, Disease, and Disorder, with complex humanitarian crises showcasing the latter threat. To illustrate factors at work, time will be devoted to “deep dives” using case studies and readings on prominent events. This seminar-style course will serve as an active “policy laboratory” in which your ideas are solicited and further shaped with the participation of the class cohort. Practical frameworks will be employed to simplify the dynamics within complex situations, and to organize your thinking about actions and options. An overnight diagramming activity assessing a humanitarian crisis between the first and second day activates analytical skills regarding causative determinants, strategic goals, and implementation of action plans. The course welcomes all learners from a wide range of knowledge, from the novice to the experienced. The course relies on active participation that feeds a mutual learning environment and that catalyzes and reveals students’ ideas as they occur, thereby fostering an at-the-ready style of nimble thinking and conversing. Alongside participation and the diagramming exercise, a pre-class, warm-up analytical exercise and a policy memorandum proposing a campaign of health security action are the chief assessable products of the course."

      "Description": "Design Thinking is a method by which we work to better understand and serve our intended users. In a public policy setting these \"users\" are often citizens and others impacted by our tools, processes and other ways government attempts to deliver services. In this course we'll learn and apply Design Thinking to challenges that are representative of real-world problems. We'll learn how to develop insights around those we need to serve, identifying and mapping out the real problem we're trying to solve for, and identify ways to provide and test solutions quickly through an iterative approach. We'll also work to investigate solutions that are equitable and work for as many people as possible - making sure that we account for extremes in our dataset and those that otherwise might be overlooked by our own assumptions. Once we've developed our insights, we'll go through Design Thinking processes to rapidly prototype and test our ideas until we can settle on a solution or two that we think will work. We'll continue to refine our best ideas and abandon those that don't appear to hold as much promise as we originally thought. As we continue through this process, we'll learn how to develop personas and begin engaging representative users so that we can test our ideas and see if what we think shows promise really meets the needs and expectations of real people. Finally, we'll discover Design Thinking approaches to ensuring that we educate our partners and fellow citizens as we go, so that in the end we all benefit from a new way of diving into issues. Students interested in testing their new-found skillsets with real-world partners and challenges are encouraged to also enroll for the Policy Innovation Lab, which follows this course. The Policy Innovation Lab is a new initiative that connects students with actual policy challenges and introduces an agile, design-driven framework to rapidly create solutions to those challenges. Students will work to solve pressing challenges by redefining the problem in terms of understanding the affected users of systems, conducting user-centered research, designing solutions, testing those same solutions, and iteratively improving those outcomes. Students of the Design Thinking class will therefore get hands-on experience leading mini-workshop exercises and assisting fellow students in the lab with the approaches they learn through this class. Students will be expected to embrace a culture that expects and encourages rapid iteration, express a willingness to fail early in order to discover a solution that ultimately works, and a flat structure that provides students with an opportunity to work and explore amongst themselves and across different teams."

As a result, organizations have become reliant upon an ability of their people and leaders to embrace continuous change for strategic gain while delivering continuous, incremental value. This explains the shift industry is making to Agile Methods; replacing outdated ways of organizing and managing software development and delivery. In this course we learn the history of agile methods, we explore Kanban, DevOps and, more deeply, the Scrum Framework, as it is the most popular and sits at the root of most every enterprise framework used to “scale agility” throughout large organizations. We teach what it means to be a modern Entrepreneurial Leader through effective Product Ownership. We teach what it means to lead effective High-Performance Teaming through Self-Leadership, Values and Principles. We teach what kind of Leadership makes or breaks this in organizations big and small, and offer many case studies, storytelling and deeper insights through in-class teaming exercises. Who this course benefits: Many are in pursuit of playing strategic Product Owner and Scrum Master roles, as well as supporting roles in Product management, development and deliver - if this is you, this is a course you really must consider - speak to your student network about the value it brings in your career goals. Agile Methods is the perfect course for entrepreneurially-minded professionals having career aspirations within any departmental functions (such as Product Management, Product Development, Human Resources, Sales & Marketing, Finance, Supply Chain, etc.) and wanting to learn through practical application how organizations deliver continuous value and embrace continuous change."

We bring in 5-7 corporate sponsors each semester (Spring and Fall) and they develop a project for the student teams to work on over the semester. Each project involves an element of measuring unstructured social data as well as providing recommendations based on its analysis. The class has been running since 2010 and we have done over 120 projects in the class for close to 100 different unique clients including Marriot, Google, Warner Bros., Sony PlayStation, Nike, Target, Ford, NYTimes, The Lincoln Center, American Express, The Gap, NBCUniversal, Microsoft, etc. We welcome graduate students from across CMU including Data Analytics, Public Policy, Entertainment and Arts Management, Business/Tepper, CS/HCI, ECE, English and Design. We socially engineer teams to add as much diversity as possible. Projects in the class vary from internal social network analysis to external client and community engagement tactics through analyzing social data from thematic strings, sentiment analysis, community segments etc. As an example, a team working with Marriott used ML models to understand and present benefit with deploying social influencers across different categories (fashion, travel, lifestyle) associated with brand recognition for their W hotel properties. Students teams have access to commercially available off the shelf software tools for social listening and social intelligence and we provide in class training. Students have reported many benefits associated with participating in the class including: Opportunity to work with students from across CMU with different experience/viewpoints, Engaging in a real world consultative project with a brand name company, Development of non-cognitive skills associated with problem solving, and An opportunity to develop and present recommendations/data models that in many cases get implemented by sponsoring organizations."

These actions opened up opportunities for computing and creativity using modern‬ ‭ technology akin to the Industrial Revolution. Richard Florida identified and coined the term‬‭ creative‬ ‭ economy‬‭ . Some have also coined this time as the second‬‭ Renaissance, noting that this era is changing‬ ‭ our core frameworks for civilization. As in the age of the Renaissance, creativity and the arts are often at‬ ‭ the cutting edge for creating and incorporating technologies in the world, even though some nonprofit‬ ‭ institutions seem slow to adapt.‬ ‭ This seminar-style course provides students with multiple perspectives on how emerging technologies‬ ‭ are transforming arts enterprises:‬‭ arts-making‬‭ ,‬‭ audience‬‭ engagement‬‭ , and‬‭ administration (also called‬ ‭ producers, intermediaries, and consumers)‬‭ . From Artificial‬‭ Intelligence to the Internet of Things to‬ ‭ Virtual Reality, students will investigate what is happening in the field and what’s on the fringe and about‬ ‭ to break into the marketplace. Through class materials, hands-on activities, and individualized‬ ‭ curiosity-fueled research, the course provides a breadth of understanding of multiple technologies.‬ ‭ Additionally, each student leaves the class with a deeper understanding of one transformational‬ ‭ technology and a hands-on experience with two technologies of their choice.‬ ‭"

      "Description": "This seminar will provide an introduction to modern U.S. energy and climate policy. Our goal will be to understand, from a practical perspective, how economics, technology, politics, public opinion and national security all influence the development and implementation of policy. With the ongoing need for an energy transition, the focus on climate change, and the impacts of the war in Ukraine, the need for understanding these issues is more important than ever. Questions that we will address include: Why has energy and climate taken on such a critical role in the public policy agenda? How has US policy changed over the years and what lessons have we learned from past initiatives? How much influence does government really have? How have new technologies changed the energy landscape and our interactions with other countries? The class will begin with an overview of the energy sector and the related government structure. We will then discuss Presidential initiatives and legislative activity, with particular attention to the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and other ongoing efforts by the Biden Administration. We will consider a variety of specific examples, such as permitting of pipelines and transmission lines, EPA regulations, and carbon pricing, that demonstrate conflicting viewpoints about appropriate energy policy. The class will also explore international energy issues like liquefied natural gas and crude oil exports, as well as UN climate agreements. This course is a seminar class; I will provide a framework and then guide a discussion among the students. We will hear from guest speakers, including a number of current and former senior government officials."

First, you should learn about a variety of management science techniques, what they are capable of, and what their limitations are so that you can intelligently call upon specialists and consultants when the occasion arises. Second, you should acquire sufficient proficiency with some of the techniques that you can use them as an “end user modeler”. Third, you should learn how to approach, abstract, and analyze problems from a quantitative, analytical perspective. In short, you should be able to use the language of mathematical modeling. In most lectures we will work through a small “case” to help you connect the methods to a problem that is richer than the typical end of chapter problem. Fourth, doing these things will prepare you to manage staff who are doing analytics projects. Walking a mile in their shoes (reflectively), will help you understand what they can and cannot do to create value for your organization."

      "Description": "This is a course in microeconomics and its implications for management and strategy – particularly (but not exclusively) in the context of information technology firms. Microeconomics, as discussed in this course, focuses on the models and methods by which managers can analyze their market and organizational environment to make optimal decisions. The key to such optimal decision-making is an understanding of the trade-offs in allocating scarce resources. The core models of microeconomics are fundamental to more applied areas of management such as strategy, marketing, production, and finance. The course will begin with an examination of the underlying structure and models of competitive markets, and the efficiency and welfare implications of those models. We will then examine economic models that describe firm output, pricing and entry/exit decisions. These models will then be applied to a variety of market contexts, including monopoly, oligopoly, and competition. As we go through this analysis, we will seek to understand the implications of the theory for information technology firms. We will also examine interesting dynamics between information, agents and economic outcomes in the context of game theory. Most of our discussions of the economic models will be accompanied by explorations of the ideas and examples presented in the Shapiro and Varian text."

      "Description": "In this course students will be introduced to Affordable Housing Policy and Finance in the U.S. Context. Approximately half of each class session will be spent describing local, state, and federal housing policies and discussing the implications (both positive and negative) of these policies in urban settings. The students will read two books to be used as aids for class discussion. The books are The Color of Law by Richard Rothstein and Evicted by Matthew Desmond. Additionally, there may be one or two occasions where a guest speaker presents a specific policy issue. The remaining half of each class session will be spent learning the financial computations used by practitioners of housing development. In other words, how are new affordable housing developments financed when the developer knows that the rents will be less than what he/she could receive on the private market? The course will cover the basic principles of both market-rate and affordable housing finance. The instructor will also teach the fundamentals of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. By the end of the course, the students will be expected to know how to calculate Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and use them to generate equity in affordable housing developments. The course is for students who may want to work for local, state, and/or the federal government directly impacting issues related to affordable housing. This course is also for students who would like to work for an affordable housing developer, a real estate practitioner, and/or is just interested in the topic of affordable housing.

The course focuses on the development of three essential skills for policy analysts: 1) Read and interpret empirical results in published research. 2) Understand the assumptions needed to infer causal relationships and assess their plausibility. 3) Recognize common problems in policy research, including reverse causality, omitted variables, measurement error, etc., and use graphical methods to determine the direction of the resulting statistical bias. Using these three skills, students will practice understanding and critiquing policy research. Moreover, by identifying and understanding potential problems, students can make valid conclusions even from seriously flawed research. At the end of the class, students demonstrate these skills by independently evaluating an existing piece of research of their choice, presenting their findings in a written report and in-class presentation. Note that the posted syllabus is for a mini-length version of the course. Moving forward, the course will be semester-long. The material covered will be very similar, but with more detail, supplementary topics, and more opportunities for students to practice their skills prior to the culminating final project."

      "Description": "This course, along with its companions (90-760 Management Science II, and an optional elective 94-833 Multicriteria Decision Making & Decision Analysis) are introductory courses in analytics and management science that survey a variety of hands-on quantitative and modeling methods useful to decision makers and analysts. We will develop a practical toolkit for solving real world decision-making problems. 90-722 focuses on optimization models and methods. Optimization models provide a quantitative framework to guide decisions when you want to maximize (or minimize) some outcome, subject to various requirements. This applies to nearly any industry, such as: booking patients for surgery to minimize wait times under schedule constraints, ordering raw supply quantities to minimize manufacturing cost under demand constraints, or allocating ventilators across hospital systems to minimize deaths under transportation constraints. By the end of the class, you will be able to take real problems such as these, translate them into mathematical formulations, solve them using Excel, and interpret the solutions. This skill will be a significant asset on the job market and in your career."

By engaging in technology as a lens, this sequence of weekend micro-courses encourages students to examine technology as a system disproportionately impacting humanity by enabling and constraining human rights of groups of people around the globe. With a multi-disciplinary focus, the course invites researchers and practitioners from the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon, and relevant fields more broadly. In Fall 2022, the focus will be on humanity’s use of technology and the disparate impacts on and benefits to the environment and varying groups of people. This will include discussion around the material, environmental, and health costs of extracting materials necessary to technology development and production as well as the waste created by the consumption habits initiated by global reliance on technology. It will also include a discussion of technology’s role in advancing sustainability. Added Note: The course will occur on Friday, Nov. 4th, Saturday, Nov. 5th, and Sunday, Nov. 6th. Engagement in the course should be synchronous; accommodations for those in significant time zone differences will be provided to allow enrollment and completion of all elements of the weekend.

      "Description": "This course provides a semester-long introduction to microeconomic analysis and its application. The primary objective of the course is to familiarize students with the microeconomic paradigm and develop an appreciation of the usefulness (and limitations) of microeconomic analysis. A further goal of the course is to develop and exercise students' ability to use economic analysis in examining applied issues and more generally to help students acquire formal modeling skills -- the ability to reduce real-world problems to useful and mathematically tractable representations. This course is designed for the following students: (i) Ph.D. students who want to increase their exposure to microeconomics but do not expect to use formal microeconomics in their research (i.e. students for whom this course is likely to be their last course in microeconomics); (ii) Ph.D. students who plan to study microeconomics beyond the introductory level of this course but do not have the background for the microeconomic sequence offered at GSIA; and (iii) M.S. students who have an especially strong background in mathematics. Notice that this course is not a close substitute for the first course in the Tepper microeconomics sequence. Students who want to take more advanced microeconomics courses and who have the preparation are encouraged to investigate the courses offered at Tepper. There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, students are assumed to have a solid working knowledge of multivariate calculus. You will take a brief math quiz in the first lecture to help you determine whether your math training is sufficient for the course. Prior exposure to microeconomics, in a good undergraduate-level course, is helpful but not required."

      "Description": "As public policy analysts, we are often presented with making decisions that are economically efficient - that is, how does one gain the most benefit for society, given limited resources? Economics provides the theoretical foundation of decision-making, but putting theory into practice is not always easy. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is an analytical tool used to determine the worth of a project, program, or policy. It identifies and attempts to quantify the costs and benefits of the project or program and provides decision-makers with manageable information to find the 'best' outcome. CBA helps managers to answer questions such as: ¿ Does the proposal provide a net benefit to the community as a whole? ¿ Should the project/program/policy be undertaken? ¿ Should the project/program be continued? ¿ Which of the alternative projects should be undertaken? The course employs various economic and statistical techniques to answer these questions, condensed into a 6-week course."

      "Description": "Statistical reasoning is essential to learning from data and understanding the strengths and limitations of data analyses. This course is grounded in questions of importance in public policy and focuses on how data and statistical reasoning can inform those questions. We will use a hands-on approach to develop skills and critical thinking in the fundamentals of causal inference, univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics, quantifying uncertainty, statistical inference, and linear regression. The hands-on approach involves learning the basics of how to use the R statistical language and weekly labs in which students will use R to carry out data analysis on real-world policy issues in a supervised setting. While useful, no R or computer programming experience is required for the course, and this course does not replace the stand-alone R course. This is a rigorous graduate school introductory statistics and data analysis course, and students who take this course will be enabled to use (and further develop) statistical reasoning and methods in your other courses, your summer internship, your Systems Synthesis Project, and in your career. In today’s information world, data are available everywhere and the role of statistics is rapidly increasing in public policy, health care, the arts, the entertainment industry, business, academia and many other parts of society.

Developments in data science, combining the increasing availability of data from internal and external sources with new algorithms that exploit that data at scale, offer new possibilities for putting product management decisions on a more quantitative and rigorous footing. Students in this course will be introduced to a variety of data science techniques applicable to activities to which product managers typically contribute. These techniques include preference modeling, time series forecasting, regression, clustering, classification, A/B testing, and analytics for unstructured data, including clickstreams, text, speech, and images. This course is for students who are looking for an introduction to applying data science to product management. Backgrounds in basic statistics, and some programming experience are required. Hands-on exercises in Python will illustrate the concepts, but please note this is not a Python class; students who are unfamiliar with Python will be given access to online tutorials to build up their Python skills. In-class exercises and weekly assignments will mainly focus on data science techniques and their application to decision making at various stages of the product life cycle. In the final project, students will select from a variety of data sets to address a product management issue in more depth, from framing the problem through modeling to communicating results. Students cannot take this course as pass/no pass."

      "Description": "This course will introduce students to the basic concepts and tools of microeconomics and welfare economics, which are used to analyze public policy from an economic perspective. We will use the economic framework to explain: 1. the demand and supply components of markets; 2. when markets are efficient and equitable; 3. how government policy relates to market failure at the microeconomic level. 4. how government policy relates to the macroeconomy. The focus of the class will be on public policy and its relation to economics. In order to apply economic concepts in a practical way, we will use current events as supplied by the textbook and by additional readings. I hope to help students further develop critical thinking skills by using economic theory as a foundation for problem analysis. Examples of issues I hope to cover are: -Is free trade a good thing? -Is a minimum wage increase a good goal for society? -How can the government reduce air and water pollution? -Why does the government regulate some markets more than others? -What are the key indicators of a good economy? -What are the differences between fiscal and monetary policy?"

      "Description": "As humans rely more and more on electronic devices to support their everyday activities, there are ever present warnings about the impacts such reliance has on human autonomy ranging from who owns and controls information networks, the inequitable impact of technology consumption on peoples and places, varying accessibility of technology around the globe, and the promises and limitations of technology in improving human health. By engaging in technology as a lens, this sequence of weekend micro-courses encourages students to examine technology as a system disproportionately impacting humanity by enabling and constraining human rights of groups of people around the globe. With a multi-disciplinary focus, the course invites researchers and practitioners from the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon, and relevant fields more broadly. In Spring 2022, the focus will be on the role governments and corporations play in the control of information networks and its impacts on privacy as well as ownership and access to data. This will include discussion of the bias and possibilities in surveillance and predictive technology on local and global communities. Added Note: The course will occur on Friday, Oct. 25, Saturday, Oct. 26, and Sunday, Oct. 27. Engagement in the course should be synchronous; accommodations for those in significant time zone differences will be provided to allow enrollment and completion of all elements of the weekend. If a student is interested in the course but unable to engage in the course dates, please reach out to Korryn Mozisek (kmozisek@andrew.cmu.edu)."

In this course, we will learn powerful but simple probability/statistical models that can be applied to fit these data to generate useful predictions. The course will go beyond pattern detections, clustering, or correlation in data to build models of plausible consumer behavior that generates the data. Thus the goal is to build a \"model\" of consumer behavior and apply this model to data to test how accurate this model is and tweak it if necessary. Most importantly, with such a model in hand, we want to predict how outcomes will change if the firm changed its strategy. Thus a key goal of the course is to teach students a model based approach to prediction."

      "Description": "Introduction Time Series Forecasting is something of a dark horse in the field of data science. It is one of the most applied data science techniques in business - used extensively in finance, in supply chain management, and in production and inventory planning. Moreover, it has a well established theoretical grounding in statistics and dynamic systems theory. Yet, it retains something of an outsider status in data science compared to more recent and popular machine learning methods such as image recognition and natural language processing. Consequently, Time Series Forecasting gets little or no treatment at all in introductory data science and machine learning courses. This course is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods without deep diving into the theoretical details behind each method. Although, the references at the end of each week will fill in many of those details. The course is intended for the following three audiences. Graduate or PhD students studying in STEM or business fields. People doing forecasting in business who may not have had any formal training in the area. MBA students doing a data elective. Also relevant for those studying public policy, healthcare management, and related disciplines."
