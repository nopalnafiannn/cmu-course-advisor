# Course Course Title: 95-481/95-881 Web Application Development
Information* Instructor: Dr. Michael Bigrigg (bigrigg@andrew.cmu.edu)
Prerequisites This course assumes no significant programming exposure, and is more highly structured to
(if applicable) support the students that may or may not have a significant programming background.

The course, Enterprise Web Development, does assume some previous programming
experience, and is less structured, for example it supports more flexibility in the choice of
course project. The course content will be different, meaning 95-881/95-481 is not a subset of
95-482/95-882.

Description* Heinz web courses are a mix of business, technology and analytics. The focus of this web
course will be on the development of content-based web products with a focus on front-end
programming. Programming in HTML and JavaScript will combine traditional software
development combined with cutting-edge Generative AI tools. AI-assisted development
platforms will be overviewed to help generate code, debug errors, and experiment with
advanced techniques.

Web applications should leverage analytics-based insights to adapt to their
users. Approaches that we will cover includes the instrumentation of a web page to capture
user behavior. We will analyze data indicators as an approach to characterize users. This
will allow our development to be driven by the ability to personalize the web application
experience. At the same time, the course will detail how the web application is used as input
to search and advertising engines which use analytics to drive users, and what to do to
optimize results. To accomplish all this, AI will be used to streamline your coding process,
inspire creativity, and accelerate problem-solving.

Course Materials Introduction to JavaScript Programming with XML and PHP (Drake)
UXPin Web UI Design Patterns 2014 (Not the later editions)
The Adaptive Web, Brusilovsky, Kobsa, and Nejdl (Eds.)
* None of these books are required and are presented here for reference.

Learning/Course 1. Understand the development of a client-side browser based web application including
Objectives* its capabilities and limitations.
## 2. Develop skills in client-side web application development technologies.

## 3. Design a web application using web programming patterns based on data analytics to

enhance the front end user experience.
## 4. Apply features to create a functioning web application.

Prerequisite It is assumed that the students would have experience with web products as a consumer.

Knowledge This includes using a web browser and search engines.

Grading Scale A+ 100% B+ 87 - 89% C+ 77 - 79%
(Minimal) A 93 - 99% B 83 - 86% C 73 - 76%
A- 90 - 92% B- 80 - 82% C- 70 - 72%
This is the minimal requirement needed to achieve each grade.

Evaluation 50% Concepts (Quizzes and/or Exams)
## Method 50% Programming Homework (30% Implementation; 20% Reflection Questions)

### Key Topics Web Design

### Front End Web Development

### Web Programming: HTML CSS JavaScript

### Web Product Patterns: Help, Focus, Personalization

Data Analytics
Course The web browser has become a major platform for application development, and its
Relevance development is fundamentally different from traditional general purpose programming. This
course focuses on the fundamentals of web development using the browser as a platform with
a focus on the client-side web application using data analytics.

Course Goals The development aspect will include HTML, Javascript and Javascript framework, such as
jQuery. This is not simply a programming course. A major emphasis is on the use of web
programming patterns with data analytics to enhance the front end user experience with
established features.

The programming will include how to implement these features that are designed specifically
for the front-end web, namely to enhance the user experience through personalization. The
students will design and develop a web application over the lifetime of the course.

Assessment There will be one course project, which includes a programming component as well as an
Structure examination component. The examination component of the project will be for the
demonstration of understanding of the concepts developed during the production of the
project. There will be quizzes, designed to reinforce material that was presented as there are
concepts that are presented in the class that are not tied to the production of the course
programming project artifact, with the weight of an exam.

Learning The books are used as reference material as needed. There is no assigned reading from the
Resources books. The internet is full of useful reference material related to this class, including
w3schools, which we will use.

Extra Time There are no additional requirements for this class beyond what would be needed to complete
Commitments assignments.

Course/Topical Programming Topics: JavaScript jQuery, and HTML/CSS
Outline: Analytics: Machine Learning, Indicators, User Clustering, and Activity Tracking
### Features: Personalization, Help, and Focus Direction

Course Policies Students with Disabilities: Our community values diversity and seeks to promote
& Expectations meaningful access to educational opportunities for all students. CMU and your instructors are
committed to your success and to supporting Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as
amended and the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990). This means that in general no
individual who is otherwise qualified shall be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits
of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity, solely by reason of having
a disability. If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact us
ASAP, and we will work together to ensure that you have the correct access to resources on
campus to assist you through your coursework and time at CMU.

Academic Integrity: Carnegie Mellon University sets high standards for academic integrity.

Those standards are supported and enforced by students, including those who serve as
academic integrity hearing panel members and hearing officers. The presumptive sanction for
a first offense is course failure, accompanied by the transcript notation “Violation of the
Academic Integrity Policy.” The standard sanction for a first offense by graduate students is
suspension or expulsion. Please see http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/ for any
questions.

Cell Phones, Smartphones and other handheld wireless devices: Other than during class
breaks, please silence ring tones and refrain from engaging in calls, messaging or other use
during class time. All devices must not be visible in any way during quizzes.

Policy Regarding Students Using English as a Foreign Language: Assignments in this
course are graded with reference to evidence of the acquisition of concepts, presentation
format, and accuracy of information. Having done business in countries that use languages
other than English, we understand that the use of an unfamiliar language can result in unusual
word choices or grammatical errors that are not critical to the overall understanding of the
information. Therefore, we will take into account your need to function in a language that may
be unfamiliar to you. We will provide feedback as appropriate if we feel that language or
grammar you have used in assignments would be best if it were configured in a different way.

Use of Canvas System for this course: The Heinz School uses Carnegie Mellon
University’s Canvas system to facilitate distance learning as well as to enhance main campus
courses. In this course, we will use the Canvas system generally to post lecture notes and
related documents and to receive assignments electronically from students.

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating
well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to
relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many
helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is
learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings
like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and
Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website
athttp://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member
you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.

We welcome feedback during and after the course. Students are encouraged to share lifeexperiences in class. We are open to suggestions about class sequences, changes to the
content and additional topics to cover.
