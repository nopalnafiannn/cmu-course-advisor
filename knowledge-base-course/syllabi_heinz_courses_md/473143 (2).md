Coursedescription: Companies,governments,andotherorganizationsnowcollectmassiveamounts
of data such as text, images, audio, and video. How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data
intoactionableinsights? Acommonproblemisthatweoftendonotknowwhatstructureunderlies
thedataaheadoftime,hencethedataoftenbeingreferredtoas“unstructured”. Thiscoursetakesa
practicalapproachtounstructureddataanalysisviaatwo-stepapproach:
(1) We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and
otherexploratorymethods.
(2) Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this
structuretomakepredictions.

Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations.

Along the way, we encounter many of the most popular methods in analyzing unstructured data,
from modern classics in manifold learning, clustering, and topic modeling to some of the latest
developments in deep neural networks for analyzing text, images, and time series, including going
over basics of large language models. We will be coding lots of Python and dabble a bit with GPU
computing(GoogleColab).

Skillsareassessedbyhomeworkassignmentsandtwoexams.

Prerequisites: If you are a Heinz student, then you must have taken 95-888 “Data-Focused Python”
or 90-819 “Intermediate Programming with Python”. If you are not a Heinz student and would
like to take the course, please contact the instructor and clearly state what Python courses you have
taken/whatPythonexperienceyouhave.

Instructionalmaterials: Thereisnoofficialtextbookforthecourse. Wewillprovidereadingmaterial
asneeded.

Homework: There are 3 homework assignments that give hands-on experience with techniques
discussed in class. All assignments involve coding in Python and working with sizable datasets
(often large enough that for debugging purposes, you should subsample the data). We will use
standardPythonmachinelearninglibrariessuchsklearnandPyTorch. Despitethethreehomework
assignments being of varying difficulty, they are equally weighted. Homework assignments are
submittedinGradescope.

Exams: There will be two in-person in-class exams that are each 80 minutes long. These exams are
“paper and pencil” exams. You are not allowed to use any electronics to complete the exam (no
phones, no calculators, no tablets, no computers, etc). Note that this is the third semester in which
exams in 95-865 are paper and pencil exams. Even though we will be providing past exams, past exams
from Spring 2023 and earlier are very different because they used to be done on a computer. Exams from Fall
2023onwardsarepaperandpencilexams.

You may bring as many sheets of notes as you would like but electronic devices will strictly be
prohibited.

Grading: Gradeswillbedeterminedusingthefollowingweights:

will receive a slight bonus at the end of the mini, which will be added directly to their Quiz 2 score
(amaximumof10bonuspoints,sothatitispossibletoget110outof100pointsonQuiz2).

Cheatingandplagiarism: Weencourageyoutodiscusshomeworkproblemswithclassmates. However, you must write up solutions to homework assignments on your own. At no time during the
course should you have access to anyone else’s code to any of the assignments including shared via
instant messaging, email, Box, Dropbox, GitHub, Bitbucket, Amazon Web Services, etc. Do not use
solutionsfrompreviousversionsofthecourse. Ifpartofyourcodeorsolutionsusesanexistingresult
(e.g., from a book, online resources such as ChatGPT, stackoverflow, etc), please cite your source(s)
(note: youarenotrequiredtocitelectureslidesordemosfrom95-865). Forexams,youranswersmustreflect
your work alone (and not that of anyone else or of any AI technology). Penalties for cheating range

from receiving a 0 on an assignment to failing the course. In extreme circumstances, the instructor

### Additionalcoursepolicies:

Late homework: You are allotted a total of two late days that you may use however you wish for
the homework assignments. By using a late day, you get a 24-hour extension without penalty. For
example:
* 
You could use the two late days on two different assignments to turn them in each 1 day (24
hours)latewithoutpenalty.
* 
Youcouldusebothlatedaysonasinglehomeworkassignmenttoturnitin2days(48hours)
latewithoutpenalty.

Note that you do not get fractional late days, e.g., you cannot use 1/2 of a late day to get a 12-hour
extension. Wewillkeeptrackofhowmanylatedaysyouhaveleftbasedonthesubmissiontimesof
yourhomeworkassignmentsonGradescope(i.e.,youdonothavetotellusthatyouareusingalate
day as we will automatically figure this out). Once you have exhausted your late days, work you submit

Courseoutline(subjecttorevision;seecoursewebpageformostup-to-datecalendar): Thecourse
is roughly split into two parts. The first part (denoted below in red) is on exploratory data analysis
in which given a dataset, we compute and visualize various aspects of it to try to understand its
structure. The second part (denoted below in blue) of 95-865 turns toward making predictions once
