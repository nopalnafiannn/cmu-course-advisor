Textbooks
Required Textbook
*  Casteel, J., ‚ÄúOracle 12c: SQL,‚Äù Cengage Learning, 2016
You do need to get hold of a copy of this book mainly for prep work readings. It
o
has been around for quite a few years, so you should be able to find some lowcost copies.

Although this book is written for Oracle 12c, the majority of the contents is
o
transferrable to other flavors of SQL, including SQLite we use in our course. I will
highlight in class and/or assignment instructions places where the SQL in Oracle
and SQLite differs.
*  Additional material from other sources will be provided by the instructor.

Additional References
In addition to the required text, the following references are recommended. Students may find it
useful to own a personal copy of one or two of the texts below.

Course Rationale: Why it matters (besides it just being a core course)
This introductory database course with a focus on SQL offers vital technical skills for
transforming complex data into actionable insights, a key competence across various disciplines
including public policy management and arts and entertainment management. SQL skills enable
public policy professionals to analyze societal data effectively, aiding in impactful policy-making.

Similarly, in arts and entertainment management, SQL proficiency is key for managing data on
productions and audience trends, supporting strategic decisions.

Learning Objectives: What you‚Äôll gain (beyond 6 academic units)
TL;DR: You'll learn to set up a simple database, understand the fundamentals of the
relational model (the most prevalent database model) and how business needs influence
its design, and write basic to intermediate SQL queries with confidence.
### By the end of the course, students should be able to:

## 1. Install and configure a simple database system following step-by-step instructions.

## 2. Describe the fundamental principles of the relational model and identify their applications in

real-world data management context.
## 3. Interpret the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) of an existing relational database depicted

in Unified Modeling Language (UML)
## 4. Explain how business rules translate into an existing relational database design in a given

real-world context and discuss its implications in the physical implementation of the
database.
## 5. Analyze a given data retrieval task in a given database and fulfill it by formulating basic and

intermediate database queries using appropriate Structured Query Language (SQL)
constructs, including:
## 5.1. Logical operators

## 5.2. Built-in functions

## 5.3. Inner and outer joins

## 5.4. Grouping and aggregation

## 5.5. Subqueries

Student Evaluation
### Your work will be evaluated on a combination of the following components:

Assessment Description Weight
Component
5 Prep Works Preliminary work that prepares you for the upcoming lecture 10%
materials. Typical in the form of reading + online quiz
consisting of multiple-answer and fill-in-the-blank questions.
5 Assignments Hands-on exercises that reinforce lecture content and 35%
occasionally introduce more challenging tasks to enhance
understanding. Assignment 1 will consist of mainly shortanswer questions on interpreting relational models. The
other assignments will typically consist of multiple query
questions: writing SQL queries to extract and present data
based on requirements given.
1 In-class SQL Lab An interactive lecture session to get you started with coding 3%
in SQL. We will complete a few SQL queries together in
class and you will turn in your work at the end of the
session.
1 Mid-term Exam* Mid-way checkpoint that assesses your understanding of 20%
the materials covered in the first half of the course and
helps you identify areas of strength and those needing
improvement. The exam consists of two parts: Part I
contains a few multiple answer questions on relational
models and SQL theories, and Part II contains a few query
questions where you are expected to write SQL queries
based on requirements given. The exam is closed-book,
closed-notes.
1 Final Exam Final evaluation your comprehensive grasp of the entire 30%
course material, ensuring you have achieved the necessary
knowledge and skills and can apply them effectively. The
format of the exam is similar to the mid-term exam. The
exam is closed-book, closed-notes.
1 Syllabus Quiz A low-stake quiz consisting of multiple-choice and multiple- 2%
answer questions with the purpose of incentivizing you to
read through the course syllabus (this document) and the
course schedule carefully.
1 Participation Bonus See details below in ‚ÄúParticipation‚Äù section 1%
bonus
* "Second-Shot Challenge": Students who scored below 70% on the mid-term exam will have an
additional assessment opportunity to increase their mid-term scores up to 70%. Details of this
extra assessment will be provided later in the semester. Please note that the Second-Shot
Challenge is only available for the mid-term exam. Due to end-of-term course grade submission
deadlines, we cannot offer this challenge for the final exam.
### Final letter grades are assigned according to the following scale:

A+ Truly Exceptional

Participation
We recognize that each student has their own preferred learning style, and we respect your
choice. However, we strongly encourage attending lectures in person, as we've noticed a
positive correlation between regular class attendance and better course performance. While I
can't definitively claim the causality between attendance and improved performance, I believe
the following factors might contribute to this correlation:
*  Physical presence in class usually leads to higher mental engagement. Your focus
on the material is likely to increase, and our interactive class activities, best experienced
in person, further boost this engagement.
### *  Attending in person allows you to ask questions and receive immediate answers

during lectures. I am committed to answering every question you raise, and I consider
this interactive Q&A the greatest value I offer: there are gazillions of YouTube videos
teaching databases better than I do, but I can provide immediate, detailed, and tailored
responses to your specific questions, a benefit you can't get from pre-recorded videos.
### *  Committing to in-person class attendance helps you develop a professional

mindset, which is more valuable for your long-term career than any specific
subjects or skills. As professionals are expected to fulfill their duties, your duty as a
student includes class attendance. Moreover, if you are unable to attend due to
circumstance like medical reasons or schedule conflicts, please notify the
teaching team via email as soon as possible. This is again an exercise in
professionalism, demonstrating respect and responsibility towards your commitments.

You will have the opportunity to earn up to 1 Participation Bonus point on your final course
score through a variety of participation opportunities including:
### *  In-person attendance to lectures

### *  Regular participation during lectures and/or office hours, asking and/or answering

questions
### *  Regular participation on Canvas discussion boards

### *  Prompt response to ad-hoc surveys / discussions (if any; to be announced by the

instructor)
The Participation Bonus point may help you achieve a better letter grade if your final
course score from the other assessment components is marginally below the threshold
of a higher grade. For example, if you receive a final course score of 89.5, a participation
bonus of 0.8 would increase your course score to 90.3, thereby helping you achieve an Ainstead of a B+. However, if your score remains below a certain threshold even after applying
the Participation Bonus, I am sorry but I cannot help you further boost your score.

Regrade Policy
If you believe that your grade is inaccurate, you may request a regrade. Please refer to the
following guidelines to determine if a regrade request is necessary / appropriate:
### *  Regrade requests must be submitted within one week of the date when the grade was

returned.
### *  Regrade requests must be in writing (via email to the instructor and all TAs) and must

include a copy of the original submission.
*  Regrade requests must specify in detail the reasons you deserve a higher grade. These
will typically be that (1) we added your scores incorrectly, or (2) the grader misread or
misunderstood your answer or did not take something into account that they should
have. For this, you should use the feedback comments as your reference point.
### *  Our top priority when grading is to maintain a consistent rubric for the same question,

which means (1) all students having the same type of error will receive the same
deduction, and (2) for a specific type of error, we cannot negotiate the rubric and make
any exception for any individual student to deduct fewer points.
### *  Different questions focus on different parts of the course material and/or evaluate

different skillsets, so their rubrics will almost certainly be different. Therefore, it is not
relevant to base your regrade request of one question on the rubric applied to a
different question.
*  Referencing another student‚Äôs grade is inappropriate and irrelevant. While we do
our best to apply an even standard across students, we cannot discuss anyone else‚Äôs
grade with you because it is against the regulations, so we need to deal with the merits
of your particular case.
### *  We reserve the right to regrade the entire assignment and thus your grade may go up or

down.
### *  The Participation Bonus is inherently subjective and therefore is not eligible for regrade

requests.

Late Submission Policy
### Policy on Assignments: Late Penalties & Late Passes

TL;DR: The late pass mechanism is designed to help you manage submission deadlines
when juggling other commitments, allowing you to avoid late penalties. Please ensure
you read and understand the policy below thoroughly to use it effectively.

To ensure that you keep pace with the course and avoid accumulating backlogs, it's important
to submit assignments on time. Assignments submitted within 48 hours after the original
deadline will incur a late penalty of 20% for every 24 hours.

We understand that unexpected situations can arise, be it a heavy workload, family
emergencies, medical conditions, or scheduling conflicts. To accommodate these challenges,
we've implemented the late pass mechanism which allows you to stagger deadlines and
manage your time more flexibly. You have a total of 48 hours of late passes available for
your assignments, which you can use in either of the following ways:
### *  Divide it into TWO 24-hour late passes for two different assignments, allowing

submission of each up to 24 hours after the deadline without penalty.
### *  Use it as ONE 48-hour late pass for a single assignment, allowing submission up to 48

hours after the deadline without penalty.

To use a late pass, you must email the teaching team (instructor and all TAs) about the type of
pass you're using (24- or 48-hour pass) before the assignment deadline. We cannot accept
late pass requests after an assignment's deadline.

If you face extenuating circumstances after exhausting your late passes, please inform us as
soon as possible. We will do our best to assist you while ensuring fairness and consistency in
our submission policy for all students. Our experience shows that alerting us about potential
issues at the earliest possible time allows us to explore more options. On the other hand,
options for situations communicated just before or after a deadline are significantly limited, so
timely communication is essential.

Assignment submissions will not be accepted more than 48 hours after the original
deadline (regardless of late passes) unless you have obtained prior approval from the
instructor. This ensures timely progress and fairness in the evaluation process, preventing
prolonged delays that could disrupt your learning pace.

Policy on Other Assessment Components (Prep Works, Labs, and Exams): No Late
Submissions
For other types of assessment components, including but not limited to prep works, labs, and
exams, late submissions are not accepted unless the instructor makes a specific
announcement. This policy is in place because prep works need to be done before their
corresponding lectures, in-class labs require immediate completion for subsequent
assignments, and exams, as high-stake assessments, require consistent submission timing for
fairness and uniformity. Consequently, late passes cannot be used towards these
assessment components.

In case you think you may miss any of these assessment components due to extenuating
circumstances, it is essential that you inform us immediately so that we may find an
appropriate solution to address your special needs while ensuring fairness and consistency for
all students. Again, the sooner you let us know, typically the more options we can explore.
### Policy on Collaboration and Cheating

TL;DR: Do not show your work (queries, codes, written responses, etc.) to anyone else
nor look at the work of anyone else unless the person is a teaching team member.

Unless otherwise announced by the teaching team, all the work you submit should reflect
individual effort. You are encouraged to discuss the high-level concepts related to the
assignment questions with fellow students (with the exception of quizzes and exams), but the
final work product must reflect your knowledge and effort, not your classmates.

You must acknowledge in your submission any help received on your assignments. That
is, you must include a comment in your homework submission that clearly states the name of
the book(s) and/or online source(s) from which you received assistance. Under circumstances
announced by the teaching team that collaboration is allowed, you must also state the name of
the student you collaborated with and/or the person(s) from which you received assistance.
### Cheating includes but is not necessarily limited to:

## 1. Submission of work that is not your own for papers, assignments, lab exercises, or

exams.
## 2. Submission or use of falsified data.

## 3. Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam, current or previous.

## 4. Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination.

## 5. Use of unauthorized material including textbooks, internet material, notes, or computer

programs (including generative AI tools) in the preparation of an assignment or during an
examination, unless otherwise indicated.
## 6. Supplying or communicating in any way unauthorized information to another student for

the preparation of an assignment or during an examination.
## 7. Collaboration in the preparation of a solution to a problem unless expressly allowed by

the assignment.
## 8. Plagiarism which includes, but is not limited to, failure to indicate the source with

quotation marks or footnotes where appropriate if any of the following are reproduced in
the work submitted by a student:
a. A graphic element.
b. A proof.
c. A phrase, written or musical
d. Specific language.
e. An idea derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another person.
f. Program code or algorithms.

If you are unsure about what is acceptable, you should consult with the instructor.

Penalties for Cheating
Penalties imposed are at the instructor‚Äôs discretion. In this class, the penalty imposed can be
any of the following depending on the violation:
*  zero on the assignment
*  a letter reduction on final course grade (e.g., final grade of A- becomes B-)
*  a failing grade in the course
Regardless of the penalty imposed, all incidents of cheating are reported to the
Associate Dean. Additional penalties may be imposed.

Recording of Class
All lectures will be recorded so that students in this course (and only students in this course) can
re-watch past class sessions. The recordings will be made available on Canvas typically by the
end of the day on which the lecture takes place. Recordings of class sessions are covered
under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and must not be shared
with anyone outside your course-section.

No student may record any classroom activity without express written consent from the
instructor. If you have (or think you may have) a disability such that you need to record or tape
classroom activities, you should contact the Office of Disability Resources to request
appropriate accommodation.

Disability Accommodations
If you have a disability and are registered with the Office of Disability Resources, you must
notify me of your accommodations and discuss your needs with me as early in the semester
as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate.

Please note that some accommodations (such as flexibility in attendance and flexibility in
assignments) cannot be implemented into the course unless you discuss it with the faculty
member and develop a written agreement (consult the Office of Disability Resources for further
detail). If you feel that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but
are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at
access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Diversity Statement
We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity
is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community.

Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race,
color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion,
creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities,
along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and
staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not
only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice.

We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of
our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces
these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional.

They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the
university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or
hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment
of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the
following resources:
*  Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
*  Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a report by
calling 844-587-0793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com.

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following
actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform
our campus climate to be more equitable and just.
### Research to Improve the Course

For this class, I am conducting research on student outcomes. This research will involve your
work in this course. You will not be asked to do anything above and beyond the normal learning
activities and assignments that are part of this course. You are free not to participate in this
research, and your participation will have no influence on your grade for this course or your
academic career at CMU. If you do not wish to participate or if you are under 18 years of age,
please send an email to Chad Hershock (hershock@andrew.cmu.edu) with your name and
course number. Participants will not receive any compensation. The data collected as part of
this research may include student grades. All analyses of data from participants‚Äô coursework will
be conducted after the course is over and final grades are submitted. The Eberly Center may
provide support on this research project regarding data analysis and interpretation. The Eberly
Center for Teaching Excellence & Educational Innovation is located on the CMU-Pittsburgh
Campus and its mission is to support the professional development of all CMU instructors
regarding teaching and learning. To minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality, the Eberly
Center will never have access to data from this course containing your personal identifiers. All
data will be analyzed in de-identified form and presented in the aggregate, without any personal
identifiers. If you have questions pertaining to your rights as a research participant, or to report
concerns to this study, please contact Chad Hershock (hershock@andrew.cmu.edu).
### Managing Stress and Obtaining Support

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well,
exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax.

This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

If you experience any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression,
we strongly encourage you to seek support. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty, or
family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.
