A geographic information system (GIS) provides an effective way to visualize, organize and manage a wide variety of information including administrative and medical record data, environmental health, social services, and other location data. Public health departments, hospitals, and medical research agencies are using GIS to map health-related events, identify disease clusters, investigate environmental health problems, and understand the spread of disease. This course uses a unique approach for teaching GIS in health care. It involves learning how to use GIS software in the context of carrying out projects for visualizing and analyzing health-related data. Each week includes lectures and computer labs that focus on a health, technical, or policy issue which use Esri's ArcGIS Pro and Platform technologies to analyze data or solve a problem. Students learn to create Story Maps and Dashboards to convey their maps and associated text to the public and decision makers. Through assignments and projects students will not only learn how to use the software but will also learn the many distinctive advantages of using GIS for health care policy making and planning. By the end of the course, students will have sufficient background so that they can become expert users of GIS in health organizations - building, managing, and using GIS maps and health data.

Using these three skills, students will practice understanding and critiquing policy research. Moreover, by identifying and understanding potential problems, students can make valid conclusions even from seriously flawed research. At the end of the class, students demonstrate these skills by independently evaluating an existing piece of research of their choice, presenting their findings in a written report and in-class presentation.",

    "description": "The purpose of Public Finance (90-736/90-435) is to provide an introduction to the theory and practice of how national, regional and local governments should and actually finance their budgets for operating and capital project purposes. To accomplish this, the course reviews: i] rationales for government intervention in the market place, ii] analyzes methods of resolving conflicts over the size of the public sector budget, iii] extensively analyzes the rationales and issues of various types of tax revenue, and iv] reviews the effects of public sector spending and taxes on the aggregate economy. Throughout, Public Finance emphasizes the interplay between how current revenue policy is fashioned, and how the models and their key assumptions along with political processes interact which result in changes in current law at the federal, state, and local levels. While the examples are largely drawn from the United States, examples are also drawn from around the world. Because the subject matter of public spending and revenues can easily consume an entire academic year of study, Public Finance focuses mainly on the revenue side of the public budget. Two courses typically offered by Professor Strauss in the Spring build on Public Finance. Public Expenditure Analysis (90-774/90-474) deals with techniques for evaluating private and public expenditure and capital spending decisions. Education Finance and Policy (90-817) deals in-depth with issues surrounding multi-level government finance from US and international perspectives. Public Finance is taught in lecture/discussion format with an emphasis on developing each student\u2019s analytical reasoning skills. Original course lecture outlines in .doc format are maintained in Canvas, along with working Excel examples used in class, and assigned and optional readings. While Public Finance and Public Expenditure Analysis are self-contained, students who have had a semester of statistics and a semester of micro-economics at the principles or Advanced Placement levels will be more comfortable. Evaluation of student performance is based on evaluation of short-essay midterms and final exams, problem sets and class participation. Students may drop the lowest midterm and problem set grade.

    "description": "After decades of slow wage growth and rising inequality, many American workers now fear an epidemic of joblessness as new technologies increasingly replace human labor. Is this likely to occur? How will emerging technologies reshape the U.S. labor market? How important is the \u201cgig economy,\u201d and how big might it become? What impact will the shocks generated by the COVID crisis and rising inflation have on employment and income inequality in the short run and the long run? What can policy makers do to ensure that the growth of the American economy is more inclusive and equitable? The curriculum of 90-745 has been rewritten to help Heinz students (and other interested CMU students) think seriously and rigorously about the future of work in the 21st century American economy. The course will place current concerns in the broader context of the major structural shifts in the U.S. labor market over the past several decades. Drawing upon the most recent quantitative analyses, the course will show that technological change has contributed to increasingly unequal outcomes in the U.S. labor market for decades, and that this trend is likely to continue as a new wave of technological change unfolds. The course will also consider the degree to which globalization, immigration, rising monopoly power, declining union strength, minimum wage laws, and discrimination based on race and gender have contributed to rising inequality in U.S. incomes. The course will draw upon frontier research to identify old and new policy ideas that could help make economic growth more inclusive, and it will bring into the classroom policy entrepreneurs who are making a real difference. The course instructor, Professor Lee Branstetter, is a globally recognized expert on the economics of innovation and technological change. He co-leads the Future of Work research initiative within Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Block Center for Technology and Society. In 2011-2012, Professor Branstetter served on the staff of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. Students enrolling in this course will have two options for grading and evaluation. Under the first option, grades will be based on a midterm, final exam, and a series of short policy essays. Under the second option, grades will be primarily based on a systems synthesis project linked to the course, through which students will be able to undertake original policy analysis for an external client on a project related to the themes of the course.

    "description": "As public policy analysts, we are often presented with making decisions that are economically efficient - that is, how does one gain the most benefit for society, given limited resources? Economics provides the theoretical foundation of decision-making, but putting theory into practice is not always easy. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is an analytical tool used to determine the worth of a project, program, or policy. It identifies and attempts to quantify the costs and benefits of the project or program and provides decision-makers with manageable information to find the \"best\" outcome. CBA helps managers to answer questions such as: \u00bf Does the proposal provide a net benefit to the community as a whole? \u00bf Should the project/program/policy be undertaken? \u00bf Should the project/program be continued? \u00bf Which of the alternative projects should be undertaken? The course employs various economic and statistical techniques to answer these questions, condensed into a 6-week course."

Two courses, Public Finance, taught in the Fall by Professor Robert Strauss, and Cost-Benefit Analysis: A Capital Budgeting Approach taught in the Spring by Professor Robert Strauss, may be viewed as providing a conceptual and practical framework for those Heinz students seeking careers in the public sector, or those parts of the private sector that routinely deal with the public sector. This course strengthens each student's ability to compare resources devoted to providing current capital projects, and those proposed to new capital projects to understand how various stakeholders both pay for and receive benefits from them over time The course is divided into 3 modules. In Module 1 (weeks 1 - 4), the course develops the essential techniques of private sector evaluation principles with a focus on long-lived capital projects and how such projects are typically financed through retained earnings, and bond and stock markets. In Module 2 (weeks 5 - 6), special problems which arise in the evaluation of public sector projects are discussed; a variety of evaluation techniques and applications especially suited to public sector projects are then examined.

    "description": "For most of the past 40 years, no region of the world has been more economically dynamic than Asia. This economic growth transformed the patterns of world trade, lifted millions out of absolute poverty, and so captivated the attention of Western economists and business leaders that it was commonplace by the early 1990s to refer to the economic achievements of these countries as the \u201cEast Asian miracle.\u201d The nature of this apparent miracle changed dramatically over the course of the 1990s as the most advanced economy in the region, Japan, suffered a sharp growth slowdown, and a number of the other \"miracle\" economies were engulfed in a regional economic crisis in the latter half of the decade. These events highlighted weaknesses in the East Asian growth model that had been hidden during the boom years. Despite these economic problems, accelerating growth in the world's most populous countries, China and India, helped sustain regional progress and kept global attention focused on economic growth in Asia through the 2000s and 2010s, even though the growth and the international attention were largely concentrated in a different set of countries. However, new worries about Chinese economic growth have emerged in recent years. Is China's growth miracle slowing down? How does the economic history of Asia's more advanced economies inform our view of the future economic prospects for India and China? In what ways are China and India pursuing a different path to economic development than that taken by their predecessors? The United States has long played an important role in Asia as an investor, customer, and key ally of important nations in the region. How will the policies of the Biden Administration shape these important relationships and the future evolution of the region? We will seek to address all of these questions.",

Because social movements have been critical to strengthening democracy and adapting societies to new conditions, we focus on those movements whose goals are democracy, equity, and justice. The course will start by analyzing the nature, organization and leadership dimensions of social movements, the role that social media plays in their success or failure, and the conditions under which social movements can build more egalitarian and just societies. Selected social movements will be analyzed either in the lectures or in the students\u2019 presentations including the Civil Rights Movement, Black Lives Matter, Environmental Justice Movements both in the U.S. and in other countries, Pro-Democracy Movements as well as Gender Equity Movements. The course will be structured around class discussions, lectures, students\u2019 presentation, and presentations by guest speakers.",

    "description": "Overview. The purpose of this Heinz public policy course is to introduce professional master\u2019s students to the special problems of financing regional governments in a decentralized federal system with a special focus on k-12 education. As a public policy course it characterizes from different vantage points the salient features of current k-12 education finance and related issues, identifies areas where there are various ideas of how to improve or promote change, and reviews the underlying methodologies with numerous examples of how to both justify and implement such changes in education finance and policy. The course is unusual in that it emphasizes both the constitutional and legal aspects of school finance and policy and draws together through problem sets and in class examples of the use actual school finance data maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Also relevancy of the course is maintained via the instructor\u2019s ongoing research in education finance and periodic involvement with the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania General Assembly, the school districts of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on matters of school finance, teacher recruitment and retention and student achievement. [See http://paeducationquality.net/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP8a2VYqPcQ] The course reviews theories of federalism from economic and constitutional perspectives, reviews the evolution of the United States from a confederation to a federation, examines financial and political problems associated with jointure, reviews alternative rationales for public financing and provision of education (k-16), distressed school systems and municipal governments, distributional effects of k-16 public education, the use of cost-effectiveness and educational production functions, school budgeting issues, the school property tax, school segregation (by race) in the US, intergovernmental relations and the design of school aid formulas, the measurement and implications of student achievement, teacher preparation and selection, and school governance issues. These issues are examined from positive and normative perspectives, and through the lens of economics and political economy. Class discussion examples will be drawn not only from Pennsylvania, but from other states, and internationally. [1] Thanks to Christine Alagara for pointing this out in class some years ago.

The course focuses on the development of three essential skills for policy analysts: 1) Read and interpret empirical results in published research. 2) Understand the assumptions needed to infer causal relationships and assess their plausibility. 3) Recognize common problems in policy research, including reverse causality, omitted variables, measurement error, etc., and use graphical methods to determine the direction of the resulting statistical bias. Using these three skills, students will practice understanding and critiquing policy research. Moreover, by identifying and understanding potential problems, students can make valid conclusions even from seriously flawed research. At the end of the class, students demonstrate these skills by independently evaluating an existing piece of research of their choice, presenting their findings in a written report and in-class presentation. Note that the posted syllabus is for a mini-length version of the course. Moving forward, the course will be semester-long. The material covered will be very similar, but with more detail, supplementary topics, and more opportunities for students to practice their skills prior to the culminating final project.",

    "description": "Pre-Requisite(s): 90-711 or 90-777. In all parts of the world, from the local to the global level, governments, funding agencies, organizations, and individuals are involved in activities meant to improve some aspect of people\u2019s lives \u2013 disaster relief in Haiti, human rights work in Sierra Leone, increasing school attendance in Detroit or improving outcomes for IV drug users in Barcelona, the list is long and ever changing. The needs addressed by these programs are often compelling and the programs themselves can be innovative, practical, and inspired. From those running and funding social programs to those whose needs are meant to be addressed by these programs a central question arises: Does this social program work? In this course you will learn how to gather and synthesize evidence to address this question. Program evaluation is the systematic application of social science methods to assess each aspect of a program: the need for the program, the program's design and implementation, and ultimately the program\u2019s impact on relevant outcomes. A completed program evaluation results in (1) information regarding the program\u2019s merit, worth, or significance, (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (3) the implications of both (1) and (2) for decision making. Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading. This course is designed to familiarize the student with the central concepts and methods of program evaluation. Students will be taught how to conduct basic program evaluations as well as how to critique and monitor more comprehensive program evaluations. Successful completion of this course will prepare students to be contributing members of teams that design and carry out program evaluations or that commission program evaluations and make decisions based upon their results.",

Public organizations in particular have an obligation to use consistent and transparent analytic tools to inform tradeoffs among competing policy priorities such as the environment, health, safety, and security. Economics provides a theoretical foundation for the allocation of scarce resources, but in practice, there are a variety of challenges in measuring benefits and costs in quantitative and monetary terms. Such challenges include determining how to value benefits and costs experienced in the future, reductions in the risk of premature death and injury, and the distribution of these impacts among affected populations, as well as appropriately characterizing uncertainty.

This \u201cmicro-mini\u201d course serves as an introduction to global health security and its intricate links to international relations and international development. As societies and economies are increasingly interconnected and thus interdependent, new forms of health security threats are arising, and nations are investing more in mutual preparedness and are conducting new forms of \u201csoft power\u201d diplomacy to mitigate those risks. In recent years, the realm of health security has expanded greatly with more governments, companies, and NGOs working to address both nascent and persistent threats. Over an immersive weekend of overview and interaction, this micro-mini highlights prominent threat categories, namely the \u201c3-D threats\u201d of Disaster, Disease, and Disorder, with complex humanitarian crises showcasing the latter threat. To illustrate factors at work, time will be devoted to \u201cdeep dives\u201d using case studies and readings on prominent events. This seminar-style course will serve as an active \u201cpolicy laboratory\u201d in which your ideas are solicited and further shaped with the participation of the class cohort. Practical frameworks will be employed to simplify the dynamics within complex situations, and to organize your thinking about actions and options. An overnight diagramming activity assessing a humanitarian crisis between the first and second day activates analytical skills regarding causative determinants, strategic goals, and implementation of action plans. The course welcomes all learners from a wide range of knowledge, from the novice to the experienced. The course relies on active participation that feeds a mutual learning environment and that catalyzes and reveals students\u2019 ideas as they occur, thereby fostering an at-the-ready style of nimble thinking and conversing. Alongside participation and the diagramming exercise, a pre-class, warm-up analytical exercise and a policy memorandum proposing a campaign of health security action are the chief assessable products of the course.",

    "description": "In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly approved The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which establish an ambitious set of goals for achieving development progress in a prescribed time frame. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent the latest effort by the international community to encourage and facilitate broad-based progress across multiple sectors in individual countries. But unlike in the past, the SDGs include social justice goals, climate-related commitments, a true focus on gender equality, and a commitment for all nations - not just those considered \"developing countries\" - to address sustainable development issues domestically. The SDGs have also opened the space for innovation, including a robust effort by regional authorities, city governments, and even institutions such as Carnegie Mellon University to adopt the Goals as a framework for expressing and planning around sustainable development commitments. The SDGs highlight the tremendous progress in improving the quality of human life that has been made during the past 200 years, and in particular since the end of World War II. Building on this record, achieving the SDGs will mark a notable step forward in addressing the most serious inequities that exist across the globe, including extreme poverty, food insecurity, illiteracy, and inadequate health care. However, pessimists worry about the enormous challenges currently confronting the international community, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. They note that by 2050 global population will reach 9.6 billion people. To feed an increasingly affluent number of people, we will need 70 percent more food production and a doubling of available water and arable land, which will come at the expense of existing natural systems. Additionally, the growing geopolitical tensions between the United States and China complicate efforts to achieve a global consensus on these challenges. For Americans, the SDGs provide a useful vocabulary and broader perspective for considering contemporary political, economic, and societal trends. In contrast to the history of American exceptionalism, the SDGs demonstrate the myriad ways that the United States is part of a global community. This course prepares CMU students to help shape the future of the planet, improve one's arguments in favor of sustainable development, and link up effectively with other leaders who are engaged in these efforts.",

President Trump promises to shake things up. The Department of Government Efficiency is targeting cuts of $2 Trillion! Think tanks are producing policy papers with recommendations, nonprofits are positioning themselves to fight for their causes, and government agencies are waiting to learn the administration\u2019s plans. Will the Department of Education be eliminated? Will the new administration consolidate all the financial regulatory agencies into one? Will all foreign assistance be deleted? This class is being designed to provide context and a framework for analyzing the first 100 days of the new administration\u2019s policies. We will be learning about policy, where ideas come from, who the players are, and how policies get executed. We will be producing quick turn-around policy memos exactly as if we were employed by a member of Congress, or working in a policy shop in a Federal, State, or local agency, or working in a non-profit association or private sector think tank.

    "description": "Empirical research is most valuable when it uses data to answer specific causal questions, as if in a randomized clinical trial. In the absence of a real experiment, we look for well-controlled comparisons and/or natural quasi-experiments. Some research designs are more convincing than others, but the econometric methods behind them are almost always fairly simple. This course provides an introduction to the most important items in an applied econometrician\u2019s toolkit: (i) analysis of randomized controlled trials; (ii) regression models designed to control for variables that may mask the causal effects of interest; (iii) difference-in-differences-type strategies that use repeated observations to control for unobserved omitted factors; and (iv) instrumental variables and regression discontinuity methods for the analysis of real and natural experiments. In this course, emphasis will be given to conceptual issues and statistical techniques that turn up in the applied research we read and do. Many empirical examples will illustrate these ideas and techniques.

The primary objective of the course is to familiarize students with the microeconomic paradigm and develop an appreciation of the usefulness (and limitations) of microeconomic analysis. A further goal of the course is to develop and exercise students' ability to use economic analysis in examining applied issues and more generally to help students acquire formal modeling skills -- the ability to reduce real-world problems to useful and mathematically tractable representations. This course is designed for the following students: (i) Ph.D. students who want to increase their exposure to microeconomics but do not expect to use formal microeconomics in their research (i.e. students for whom this course is likely to be their last course in microeconomics); (ii) Ph.D. students who plan to study microeconomics beyond the introductory level of this course but do not have the background for the microeconomic sequence offered at GSIA; and (iii) M.S. students who have an especially strong background in mathematics. Notice that this course is not a close substitute for the first course in the Tepper microeconomics sequence. Students who want to take more advanced microeconomics courses and who have the preparation are encouraged to investigate the courses offered at Tepper.

While the field is divided into for \u2013 profit and non-profit models with the need to pay the bills a recurring, common - denominator. This course focuses on the performing arts set within a (mostly) nonprofit landscape in which organizations produce and/or present works to transform audiences and serve their community via one or several intersecting art forms. Producing or presenting a successful season entails selection (planning) and implementation (managing) of programs, something that is neither easy nor consistent. Driving and complicating the situation is the common bifurcated management structure. Managers must find a way to implement the vision of an Artistic Director or other titled Artistic leader \u2013 an individual with an aesthetic and social framework that shapes an institution and its artistic offerings. Arts managers enable this artistic vision within the context of the physical, geographical, financial, and human constraints of a specific company. Combining and mixing these forces is frequently messy and always an adventure. Organizational history, indeed the history of the art form itself, often provides vexing constraints and practices to the process that must be dismantled to meet the demands of a socially just, 21st-century model. If a career of \u2018doing the same thing\u2019 is the goal, then a different field might be recommended. This course will examine approaches to producing a performing arts season of programming with an emphasis on the nonprofit season structure that meets the demands of a post-Covid-19 pandemic, digital-forward, anti-racist reality. Over 7 short weeks, we will attempt to answer the following question: How do artistic and managerial leaders move an organization and its mission through an equitable artistic vision set across a selection of programs while maintaining or creating a holistic system to manage the process and evaluate artistic success, community impact, and mission-centric strategic goals? All this while balancing the technological realities of contemporary existence. The course is a seminar. It is designed to engage your critical thinking. Reading material, watching videos, and attending performances are required. Readings will include books, excerpts, workbooks and articles on planning, management models, and styles. The frameworks for the unique qualities of the panoply of performing arts programs (season planning, education programs, etc) are our topic but within the setting and requirements of individual disciplines. The course will focus on Greater Pittsburgh (Allegheny County) \u2013 as a case study and playground but the USA offers useful examples for you to bring to the course as well.",

This is even more true as organizations continue through and emerge from the circumstances of the global pandemic. Communication is a core activity of any arts enterprise. External Relations frames and holds together the brand of all stakeholder communications across earned and contributed income streams (marketing = earned; development = contributed). Today\u2019s communication professionals are crucial to their arts organizations; they maintain existing audiences, secure new audiences, create future donors, and create the brand for the institution. They interact with all aspects of the organization, from personnel to fundraising. This course provides readings and professional presentations to guide the understanding of successful marketing and communication. From an understanding of this thought leadership, students engage in a project-based method to investigate hands-on the opportunities addressing the changes within the arts audience and the shifting digital landscape for marketing the arts in the United States. The focus of the course is marketing and communications within a nonprofit arts organization, recognizing that the audiences rarely distinguish the difference. Yet, due to budget AND purpose, marketing not-for-profit arts organizations is significantly different as compared to a for-profit entertainment venture. This course will provide each student with marketing principles and theories, as well as opportunities to actualize theories with assignments and a final project utilizing current technologies.

    "description": "This course introduces the distinctive qualities of American philanthropy, and explores the roles and responsibilities you will have as a professional fundraiser, leader, or as a staff member in a non-profit arts organization. In this fundamentals course the focus is on individual donors - their motivations, sources of contributed funds, and new and emerging fundraising techniques, although we will also explore the broad philanthropic landscape as a whole. Additional topics include legal requirements and ethical considerations that are important to fundraising, effective data management and its effects on the success of your fundraising efforts, solicitation strategies and effective communication with donors, and the principles of donor centered fundraising. We will explore the idea of a non-profit environment in transition, an environment where the fields of arts and culture compete with social services, education, and global philanthropic needs for a limited pool of dollars; where we are under increasing pressure to make the case for relevance and civic stature; where our funders - whether individual philanthropists, foundations, corporations, or government - have changing and higher expectations around both involvement and accountability.",

According to the Recording Industry Association of America, music revenues in 2016 were the highest they've been in over eight years with the largest year-over-year percentage increase in over 18 years. However, these numbers do not reflect the tumultuous waters in which those connected to the music industry find themselves today. While streaming services have increased accessibility, the issues of piracy and artist control are of grave concern. This course will examine how the record labels and publishers are responding to the changing economy of the music industry. Discussions will address the big players in the music industry (Sony Music, Universal Music, Warner Music Group, Sony/ATV, & UMPG) as well as indie record labels' business strategy, how legal aspects of the music industry effect artists, publishers, and consumers (digital rights management, etc.), as well as the ever-increasing reliance on streaming and the technical companies providing music services. Topics to be examined include copyright law, label and publishing agreements with artists, and backend monetization of assets.",

Les Paul stands out as a visionary who invented the modern recording studio, introducing multi-track recording, digital delay, reverb, and echo. He also created the electric pickup, leading to the first solid-body electric guitar. Without his innovations, iconic works like The Beatles\u2019 Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band, Legendary Guitarist, Eddie Van Halen, Pro Tools, and Garage Band might not exist. Despite receiving numerous honors and awards throughout his lifetime, including being named the 18th best guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine, Les Paul is among the few artists to have a permanent exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Additionally, he is the only individual to be inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the National Inventors Hall of Fame. This course explores Les Paul\u2019s transformative contributions and artistic achievements. Alongside his partner Mary Ford, Paul had over 33 Top 20 hits across Jazz, Pop, Country, and R&B. Despite his unmatched influence, many remember him primarily as a legacy artist. Through lectures at the MEIM, Los Angeles campus, and a hands-on session at The Les Paul Studio at United Recording in Hollywood, students will experience Les Paul's original mixing board and engage with top studio producers. This course is designed for both music enthusiasts and anyone interested in the history, innovation, and technology of modern music.",

We will address issues such as the following: What factors best explain the level and rate of growth of U.S. health expenditures? Does the recent high rate of growth of U.S. health care expenditures make U.S. firms less competitive in international markets? What are some of the likely consequences (intended and unintended) of Federal health care reform? What are the impacts of health care consolidation? What is required for the ACA's health insurance exchanges to work well?",

    "description": "Marketing is going through a radical shift from traditional to digital, broadcast to hyper targeted, internally focused to collaborative across the extended organization. In addition, we are seeing a dramatic shift from a concentration on products and services driven through sales to focusing on customer experience and engagement. Historically, marketing decisions were based on intuition, anecdotal information, company capacity and what has worked in the past. John Wanamaker, a successful United States merchant who opened one of the first and most successful department stores in the United States, which grew to 16 stores and eventually became part of Macy\u2019s, coined the term - \u201cHalf the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half\u201d. Dramatic shifts in the marketspace (for example the pandemic) have resulted in changes in consumption, shocks to the supply chain and changes in how organization engage and interact with consumers. In addition, disruption patterns (e.g. new entrants) result in fragmentation threatening market share especially for incumbents. Marketing is increasingly being called on to assess organizational strategies to deal with these shifts. With an increasingly digitized society, data has allowed marketers to assess different channels for interaction, monitor the customer journey and measure interaction, brand awareness and consumer sentiment. Marketers are looking to develop individualized consumer experiences which is predicated on data as well as revising processes and interaction across the extended enterprise. Anticipation, resiliency and adaption to these evolving industry dynamics, shocks to the system and changing consumer expectations, is key for staying relevant and being able to take advantages of opportunities as they present themselves. This class is designed to provide students basics of modern marketing but more importantly how they are applied in today\u2019s environment. In addition, it will cover current issues confronting marketers including messaging bias, data privacy, brand interruption/hijacking, social influence, misinformation, etc. The professor will review new concepts each week, in class exercises will be done to apply those concepts and homework will be used to reinforce methods and critical thinking associated with case study. Students will be assigned to teams for the in-class exercises as well as the final (Case scenario, recommendation and analysis). Each week, readings will be assigned covering topical information on that week\u2019s subject.",

The question is how to convert this diverse and disorganized data into useful information. One common issue is that the underlying structure of the data is not always known before analyzing it, which is why it is called \"unstructured.\" This course aims to provide a hands-on approach to analyzing unstructured data. We first investigate how to recognize any potential structure that may be present in the data through utilizing visual representation and other techniques for investigating the data. Once we have indications of what structure may be present in the data, we can use it to make predictions. Throughout the course, we will come across several widely used techniques for analyzing unstructured data. This includes both established methods such as manifold learning, clustering, and topic modeling, as well as newer approaches like deep neural networks for analyzing text, images, and time series. The course will involve a lot of coding using Python and we will also explore using GPU computing through Google Colab.",

    "description": "Privacy is a complex and multi-faceted concept. This course combines technical, economic, legal, psychological, ethical, and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and function in the digital age. The reduction of the cost of storing and manipulating information has led organizations to capture increasing amounts of information about individual behavior. New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive. Is there a \u201csweet\u201d spot that satisfies the interests of all parties? Is there a combination of technological solutions, economic incentives, and legal safeguards that is acceptable for the individual and beneficial to society? This course tries to address the above questions. Note: while many of the topics covered in the course may include information of practical relevance to privacy professionals (that is, those of you specifically interested in managing privacy issues in the workplace), please note that the primary learning objective of this course is broader and more conceptual: it is about providing students with a holistic view of the role and function of privacy in the digital age, and a critical understanding of its many different dimensions (economic, technological, policy, and so forth), so that the students may be equipped to apply that knowledge across different environments, including policy-making, industry, and research.

In a public policy setting these \"users\" are often citizens and others impacted by our tools, processes and other ways government attempts to deliver services. In this course we'll learn and apply Design Thinking to challenges that are representative of real-world problems. We'll learn how to develop insights around those we need to serve, identifying and mapping out the real problem we're trying to solve for, and identify ways to provide and test solutions quickly through an iterative approach. We'll also work to investigate solutions that are equitable and work for as many people as possible - making sure that we account for extremes in our dataset and those that otherwise might be overlooked by our own assumptions. Once we've developed our insights, we'll go through Design Thinking processes to rapidly prototype and test our ideas until we can settle on a solution or two that we think will work. We'll continue to refine our best ideas and abandon those that don't appear to hold as much promise as we originally thought. As we continue through this process, we'll learn how to develop personas and begin engaging representative users so that we can test our ideas and see if what we think shows promise really meets the needs and expectations of real people. Finally, we'll discover Design Thinking approaches to ensuring that we educate our partners and fellow citizens as we go, so that in the end we all benefit from a new way of diving into issues. Students interested in testing their new-found skillsets with real-world partners and challenges are encouraged to also enroll for the Policy Innovation Lab, which follows this course. The Policy Innovation Lab is a new initiative that connects students with actual policy challenges and introduces an agile, design-driven framework to rapidly create solutions to those challenges. Students will work to solve pressing challenges by redefining the problem in terms of understanding the affected users of systems, conducting user-centered research, designing solutions, testing those same solutions, and iteratively improving those outcomes. Students of the Design Thinking class will therefore get hands-on experience leading mini-workshop exercises and assisting fellow students in the lab with the approaches they learn through this class. Students will be expected to embrace a culture that expects and encourages rapid iteration, express a willingness to fail early in order to discover a solution that ultimately works, and a flat structure that provides students with an opportunity to work and explore amongst themselves and across different teams.",

    "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries by driving innovation, improving efficiency, and enhancing decision-making processes. Yet, despite its potential, many AI projects face significant hurdles in deployment. According to a recent survey, only 22% of data scientists report that their \"revolutionary\" AI initiatives\u2014those designed to enable new processes or capabilities\u2014usually reach deployment. Alarmingly, 43% say that 80% or more of their AI projects fail to make it into production. Even when considering all types of machine learning projects, including those focused on refreshing existing models, only 32% of models typically deploy. These statistics underscore the critical challenges of scaling AI systems effectively. This course is designed to tackle these challenges head-on, providing graduate-level students with a comprehensive understanding of the AI lifecycle. Students will learn how to navigate the complex process of identifying which business tasks should be automated through AI and which decisions should be augmented using AI. The course introduces practical frameworks essential for making these strategic decisions and successfully implementing AI solutions. Throughout the course, students will engage deeply with each stage of the AI lifecycle. They will learn to identify and prioritize high-impact AI use cases, conduct thorough cost-benefit analyses, and design strategic roadmaps aimed at maximizing return on investment (ROI). The curriculum blends theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience using industry-standard tools such as Jupyter Lab, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, and Evidently. These tools are critical for overcoming the common pitfalls associated with AI deployment and preparing students to scale AI systems in real-world environments. The course\u2019s practical orientation is further enhanced through case studies that serve as a foundation for class discussions. These case studies provide students with the opportunity to analyze real-world AI applications, assess the challenges involved, and understand the decision-making processes behind successful implementations.

The key to such optimal decision-making is an understanding of the trade-offs in allocating scarce resources. The core models of microeconomics are fundamental to more applied areas of management such as strategy, marketing, production, and finance. The course will begin with an examination of the underlying structure and models of competitive markets, and the efficiency and welfare implications of those models. We will then examine economic models that describe firm output, pricing and entry/exit decisions. These models will then be applied to a variety of market contexts, including monopoly, oligopoly, and competition. As we go through this analysis, we will seek to understand the implications of the theory for information technology firms.

    "description": "When is making a change to a webpage, an algorithm, or products worthwhile? Should I increase or decrease prices? Is my advertising cost-effective? Rather than simply relying on the intuition of managers, businesses increasingly strive to accurately identify the impact of their actions. This is particularly the case in the digital economy where firms have access too large amounts of data. However, properly identifying the causal effect of a business change requires knowledge of the appropriate methods. One such methods is to conduct field experiments, also referred to as A/B tests. Yet, implementing experiments is not always straightforward but instead requires a thorough understanding of both the underlying business problem as well as the challenges associated with the identification of causal effects. This class teaches methods for measuring the true impact of business changes in the digital economy. Because of the prevalence of A/B testing in practices, we especially emphasize how A/B tests work and how to apply them. We will have hands-on discussions of how managers can measure impact in business situations and how to evaluate claims of impact made by others. While the focus will lie on A/B testing, we will also discuss other methods that can be used when experiments are not feasible. Methods are illustrated with examples from a variety of digital businesses including Microsoft, Amazon, eBay and Uber. We will cover examples in a variety of topical areas including advertising, pricing, product design and distribution channel decisions. Guest speakers will discuss the practical importance and challenges of implementing A/B as well as what firms can do when implementing straight-forward A/B tests is not practical.",

It is one of the most applied data science techniques in business - used extensively in finance, in supply chain management, and in production and inventory planning. Moreover, it has a well established theoretical grounding in statistics and dynamic systems theory. Yet, it retains something of an outsider status in data science compared to more recent and popular machine learning methods such as image recognition and natural language processing. Consequently, Time Series Forecasting gets little or no treatment at all in introductory data science and machine learning courses. This course is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods without deep diving into the theoretical details behind each method. Although, the references at the end of each week will fill in many of those details. The course is intended for the following three audiences. Graduate or PhD students studying in STEM or business fields. People doing forecasting in business who may not have had any formal training in the area. MBA students doing a data elective.

Developments in data science, combining the increasing availability of data from internal and external sources with new algorithms that exploit that data at scale, offer new possibilities for putting product management decisions on a more quantitative and rigorous footing. Students in this course will be introduced to a variety of data science techniques applicable to activities to which product managers typically contribute. These techniques include preference modeling, time series forecasting, regression, clustering, classification, A/B testing, and analytics for unstructured data, including clickstreams, text, speech, and images. This course is for students who are looking for an introduction to applying data science to product management. Backgrounds in basic statistics, and some programming experience are required. Hands-on exercises in Python will illustrate the concepts, but please note this is not a Python class; students who are unfamiliar with Python will be given access to online tutorials to build up their Python skills. In-class exercises and weekly assignments will mainly focus on data science techniques and their application to decision making at various stages of the product life cycle. In the final project, students will select from a variety of data sets to address a product management issue in more depth, from framing the problem through modeling to communicating results.

    "description": "Companies, governments, and other organizations now collect massive amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video. How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights? A common problem is that we often do not know what structure underlies the data ahead of time, hence the data often being referred to as \u201cunstructured\u201d. This course takes a practical approach to unstructured data analysis via a two-step approach: We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this structure to make predictions. Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations. Along the way, we encounter many of the most popular methods in analyzing unstructured data, from modern classics in manifold learning, clustering, and topic modeling to some of the latest developments in deep neural networks for analyzing text, images, and time series, including going over basics of large language models. We will be coding lots of Python and dabble a bit with GPU computing (Google Colab). Note regarding GenAI and foundation models (such as large language models): As likely all of you are aware, there are now technologies like (Chat)GPT, Gemini, Claude, Llama, etc which will all be getting better over time. If you use any of these in your homework, please cite them. For the purposes of the class, I will view these as external collaborators/resources. For exams, I want to make sure that you actually understand the material and are not just telling me what someone else or GPT/Gemini/etc knows. This is important so that in the future, if you use AI technologies to assist you in your data analysis, you have enough background knowledge to check for yourself whether you think the AI is giving you a solution that is correct or not. For this reason, exams in this class will explicitly not allow electronics.",

The course will go beyond pattern detections, clustering, or correlation in data to build models of plausible consumer behavior that generates the data. Thus the goal is to build a \"model\" of consumer behavior and apply this model to data to test how accurate this model is and tweak it if necessary. Most importantly, with such a model in hand, we want to predict how outcomes will change if the firm changed its strategy.

Like archaeological remnants, data, by its very nature, is a marker of what happened in the past. How can data be used to better understand this past and what is happening in the present? How can data be leveraged to forecast what will happen in the future? Better still, how can data be used to mold what should happen in the future? In this course we will study descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive methods by which data can be used to gain insight and inform actions of people and organizations. The real excitement of data science is in the doing. This is an application oriented course requiring skill in algorithmic problem solving. We will use Python based data science tools.
