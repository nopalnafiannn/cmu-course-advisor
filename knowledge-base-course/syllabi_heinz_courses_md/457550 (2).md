Course Description
The world is undergoing monumental change. These transformations are fueled by the aftermath of the
entry of the personal computer to the mass marketplace and the introduction of the World Wide Web in
the mid-1990s. These actions opened up opportunities for computing and creativity using modern
technology akin to the Industrial Revolution. Richard Florida identified and coined the term creative
economy . Some have also coined this time as the second Renaissance, noting that this era is changing
our core frameworks for civilization. As in the age of the Renaissance, creativity and the arts are often at
the cutting edge for creating and incorporating technologies in the world, even though some nonprofit
institutions seem slow to adapt.

This seminar-style course provides students with multiple perspectives on how emerging technologies
are transforming arts enterprises: arts-making , audience engagement , and administration (also called
producers, intermediaries, and consumers) . From Artificial Intelligence to the Internet of Things to
Virtual Reality, students will investigate what is happening in the field and what’s on the fringe and about
to break into the marketplace. Through class materials, hands-on activities, and individualized
curiosity-fueled research, the course provides a breadth of understanding of multiple technologies.

Additionally, each student leaves the class with a deeper understanding of one transformational
technology and a hands-on experience with two technologies of their choice.

Please note: The material submitted for your review assignment or your rabbit hole may be considered
for the content created for AMT Lab ( www.amt-lab.org ) Readers for the platform are arts management
professionals working in the field. Approximately 150,000 individuals from around the world read the
content annually (ages 25 - 40 on average, on desktop computers, 9 - 5:00pm). IF recommended for AMT
Lab, the content is passed on to the Chief Editor of Research (Hannah Brainard), who will work with you
directly. If you are interested in the potential for publication, please complete your interest in publication

Course Requirements
Engagement
As a seminar, active in-class contributions are expected. Hence, engagement is assumed, but attendance
is required to engage. Hence, roll-call will be used on Canvas to track attendance. Should such
circumstances arise (hospitalization, earthquake, etc.), please make every effort to let me know before
class begins. Illness and life events are inevitable, but recognize that your presence is important for our
intellectual growth as a class as a whole due to the collaborative environment of the class. You must
reschedule with the TA if you miss one of the share-out days. Attendance will be tracked in Canvas and
taken at the beginning of class. If you attend less than 80% of the class, your final course grade will be
dropped by 10%.

Syllabus Fall 2024 93.830 Technologies Transforming Arts Enterprises
Active class participation is expected. The class will offer opportunities to learn in an active and
synergistic and collaborative manner. Class time will include discussing preparation materials, in-class
projects, platform critiques, oral presentations, and sharing thoughts and ideas.

Due to the depth of the content and the limited in-class time together, this course utilizes various
technologies: Canvas, Google, and a course Wordpress site. You are strongly encouraged to use Zotero to
track your research sources. Zotero workshops are available. The instructor is happy to demonstrate the
tool during class or office hours.
● Canvas will serve as a conduit to the course website, it relays deadlines, and it is a place where
you submit your work. It also is the hub for out-of-class conversations, class curation, and weekly
news.
● Google Drive will be a location where we offer collaborative opportunities, including your Hands
On Reports and possibly your final report (depending on your format choice)
● For private communication, Canvas mail or chat.google.com are always options.

Course time commitments
The course is a mini course. 12 hours per week are expected for mini-courses. A typical week would
include:
● Preparing for class by reading the assigned article or watching videos, or listening to a podcast.
● Completing the Weekly News + questions for the week if it is one of your 3 weeks
● Attending class.
● Doing assignments
### *  Doing a Hands-On with your partner OR

*  starting your rabbit hole research and bibliography OR experimenting with software for
your review
### *  Writing up your Hands-On experiment, review, or your rabbit hole (alternative recording

your rabbit hole podcast)
We recommend that you schedule your limited resource: time . Try using a detailed (by-the-hour)
planner to allot the time to accomplish the work needed for this course and other courses and life
commitments. Time management is one of the most important elements of success as a graduate
student at Heinz College.
### Course learning assessments:

● Weekly News + Question/Thought – Earn up to 21 points with one per week. No extra
credit/no make-up for missed weeks. For each week, you will look at the news covering emerging
technology in your field that aligns with the topic for the day using one of the platforms provided
(see assignment and list above). Why? Technology opportunities are evolving faster than any
one person can track. As a group, we can keep up to date with the field together. The full
assignment is provided separately and on Canvas including the grading rubric. You will post your
weekly news to Discussion Board by midnight on Wednesdays. 50% loss of points if posted after
that time. Zero if posted after class begins.
### *  The post on discussion board should include:

■ A link / the URL to the article (be sure it is clickable - add a space after you paste
it in)
Syllabus Fall 2024 93.830 Technologies Transforming Arts Enterprises
■ Include a 2-3 sentence “remark” that explains what you found interesting in the
article, how it relates to the day’s topic, and how it is transforming your industry
ecosystem. The news piece may be regarding arts, entertainment/media, arts
management or related technology (for example – an article on RFID upgrades
might not scream arts but it has use-value for the arts, e.g. Disney wristbands)
AND where the technology affects the enterprise (program, internal, external,
infrastructure)
■ A question or thought from the materials provided for class discussion
■ It is a graded assignment (3 points total NOTE: the assignment score is
REDUCED by .5 points if the resource was published more than 18 months ago.)
● Hands-On Play Time *Earn up to 30 points (15 per Hands-On)
■ 2 Hands-on experiments will be completed and documented (model and form
for each hands-on provided via Canvas. The format is provided through google
drive with a linked Google doc for you to copy). Results will be turned in via pdf
in Canvas and shared out through an in-class round-robin exercise. The
round-robin consists of a < 3 minute share of your experiment to a subset of
your peers who will give you individualized feedback.
■ This work is to be done in randomized pairs . Each Hands-On has an engage-with
portion and a maker portion.
## 1. AI: engage with a chat bot on Facebook or on a website. How do you

know when is it real and when is it a bot? How can you tell? Now create
a chatbot for a performance or exhibit OR create a small robot.

Tools/Demos provided.
## 2. Pick 1 of 3: VR or VR or 3-D printing: Engage in a VR arts performance or

AR art experience or 3-D touch tour (local museums have a plethora of
opportunities as does the web). What was it like? What worked? What
didn't? Now, try making your own). Tools/Demos provided.
● Rabbit Hole Project (earn up to 35 points)
### *  Your focus for your project will be topics relevant to your industry, complex enough to be

worthy of deeper research, and something you’re highly curious about from the content
areas of the class. Weekly news can serve as a resource for ideas or starting points for
your rabbit hole, but final topics will be determined in conversation with the professor.

You will submit ideas for review several weeks prior to due dates. NOTE: The key is
finding a topic and then asking a question that you want to find the answer to. Your
work can be a case study, a literature review of impacts or opportunities in your field of
a particular technology, or even a comparative product review of the technology itself.
(samples below)
### *  The goal is to share your findings digitally and in a form that is academic and

professional while being digitally advanced, not solely text-based. Data-informed, digital
storytelling skills should be used, and you will find that you improve them as the course
proceeds. Students are encouraged to use multimedia and interactive tools to enhance
communication of the findings in their rabbit holes. All rabbit holes will be turned in via
Canvas.
*  We have 3 core modules and 1 rabbit hole. Your rabbit hole mustrelate to one of them.

Syllabus Fall 2024 93.830 Technologies Transforming Arts Enterprises
### *  Everyone’s rabbit hole will move through a similar process at the beginning:

■ Submit 3 topic areas and possible questions you’d like to investigate. You will
receive feedback and advice from the instructor and/or TA.
■ Once selected, you will create a preliminary ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY using
Chicago Style that documents the what you are finding in your adventure. It
should include at minimum 12 significant and reliable resources with 2 – 3
sentence summaries. If you have over 20 items you have gone too far ☺ None
of the items can be Wikipedia entries although it is a useful resource for reliable
sources. Examples of annotated bibliographies are available here:
*  https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/common_writing_
assignments/annotated_bibliographies/index.html or
https://www.scribbr.com/chicago-style/annotated-bibliography/
■ Determine which of the three reporting modes you want to use: 1) Create a
Podcast (a short podcast primer of how is provided on Canvas and include a
‘show notes’ document )or 2) Video with visuals/slides to support your
argument, OR 3) create a final report on a google doc or google site.
● The full assignment with rubric is provided via Canvas.
■ A 2-minute share-out ‘elevator pitch’ during class that explains (hard stop at 2
minutes)
● what the technology is
● how it is being used in your rabbit hole’s focus
● how it is transforming the arts as covered in the rabbit hole.
■ Turn in a final report/podcast/video that will effectively communicate the
technology and its impact on the field. If your rabbit hole is a comparative app
review, it should still be written but with a slightly different format with
takeaways and a writing style relevant to a professional in the field. The report
should include digital storytelling techniques (graphs, images, etc.), even if it is a
podcast (think show notes), to convey the concepts and reach a length of
anywhere from 1200 - 2000 words or 15 – 20 minutes. The length is suggested
but not a formal boundary. Work with your professor and TA to ensure you are
achieving the reporting depth and rigor expected.
■ Read your “Rabbit Hole Partner” and give feedback as a comment on their work
in Canvas. Your comment should include:
● Something you liked about their research
● Something you liked about their report
● Something you would recommend they try next time to improve their
research and/or their approach to sharing their findings
### Helpful hints:

● How do I pick my rabbit topic and question? Using course topics or
inspiration from Weekly News, you will work with the instructor/TA to
refine research topic. The following are sample questions with linked
answers.
●
Syllabus Fall 2024 93.830 Technologies Transforming Arts Enterprises
● Samples:
*  What is the best reader app?
### *  How do you understand facial recognition software in the world

of data security
*  What are the streaming trends in media?
*  How do arts organizations write privacy policies?
*  How can digital technologies support choreography or dance?
### *  Final Reflection (earn up to 7 points)

### *  History of the Future / Technology Reflection (earn up to 7 points)

■ The prompt is provided foron Canvas. You may submit a 3 - 5 page (double
spaced) thoughtful reflection or a video conversation of up to 5 minutes.
### Extra Credit (potential 1.5% to final grade) :

● Complete your FCE’s. 80% completion rate will earn an extra .5% for your final grade. And an
additional .1% for each completion point above up to a max of 1.5%.

Syllabus Fall 2024 93.830 Technologies Transforming Arts Enterprises
Late work : Rabbit Hole, Reflections, and Hands-Ons have a 48-hour grace period, recognizing that
conflicts happen. No request is required but it is always good to keep your professor and TA aware of
your circumstances . HOWEVER, the elevator pitch for the Rabbit Hole and hands-on share-out is
expected ON TIME or you will receive a grade of zero unless due to illness an alternative plan has been
created and approved by the professor PRIOR to the due date. All work received after grace period loses
10% of the final grade every day. Rationale: You cannot turn in a grant late, and in an IRL environment,
you are expected to let your supervisor know if you are going to miss a deadline.

### Course & Classroom Policies and Expectations

Recording Class Sessions. Classes will not be recorded unless there are external requirements from the
administration, for example, if we have Covid Protocols, and are moved to a Zoom environment. If you
are provided with an accommodation that requires recording, please notify the professor immediately.

Should we pivot, we will also be following a shared set of Digital Agreements for Zoom protocols.

Food/Drink. You are permitted to eat and drink in class as long as you do not disrupt others in the class,
and you clean up after yourself.

Cell Phones. MUST be kept in your bag with notifications turned off.

Computers. Computers or tablets should be charged and available for every class meeting. Sometimes
we will be using them during class. Sometimes we need to be focused on interpersonal interaction with
a direct request to put our computers away.

Citation Guidelines: This class uses Chicago Style 17, Notes & Bibliography format:

### Intellectual and Professional Integrity

This course is an integral part of your graduate education, an education that is designed to provide you
with the tools for a successful, professional career. Assumed within is a high standard of ethics and
integrity. You are expected to have read and understood the Student Handbook. Plagiarism and other
forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely serious matters. Misrepresentation of
another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious violations. Cases of
cheating and plagiarism will receive a grade of zero and, per requirements, be submitted to and
reviewed by the Dean’s Office, where more severe penalties may be imposed, up to and including
expulsion from the Heinz School. If any academic integrity violation occurs during this course, the
Syllabus Fall 2024 93.830 Technologies Transforming Arts Enterprises
assignment will receive a zero for all those involved, and the violation will be reported to the Dean of
Heinz College and CMU Office of Students.

Generative AI Tools will be used in the classroom. You are welcome to use generative AI programs
(ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc.) in this class. These programs can be powerful tools for learning and other
productive pursuits, including completing some assignments in less time, helping you generate new
ideas, or serving as a personalized learning tool.

However, your responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow the academic integrity
guidelines of the university and this class . If you use one of these generative AI tools to develop content
for an assignment, you are required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work. In practice, cutting
and pasting content from any source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing content
from a generative AI without citation is plagiarism. Similarly, using any generative AI tool without
appropriate acknowledgment will be treated as plagiarism. The university’s policy on plagiarism applies
to all uncited or improperly cited use of work, whether that work is created by human beings alone or in
collaboration with a generative AI.
### You may use generative AI programs to:

### - Brainstorm new ideas

### - Develop example outlines or approaches to your work

### - Research topics, or generate different ways to talk about a problem

### You may not use generative AI programs to:

### - Generate content that you cut and paste into an assignment with a written component without

quotations and a citation
### - Generate content that is not adequately paraphrased without a citation

### - Generate bibliographies for topics that you haven’t researched yourself

### - Generate other content (images, video, others) unless expressly permitted and following

provided guidance
### - Otherwise, use or present generative AI content that you pass off as your own work, when really

it is not
Here is a citation model for GenAI
https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Documentation/faq0422.html
Finally, it is important that you recognize that large language models frequently provide users with
incorrect information, create professional-looking citations that are not real, generate contradictory
statements, incorporate copyrighted material without appropriate attribution, and sometimes integrate
biased concepts. Code generation models may produce inaccurate outputs. Image generation models
may create misleading or offensive content.

While you may use these tools in the work you create for this class, it is important to note that you
understand you are ultimately responsible for the content that you submit. Work that is inaccurate,
biased, unethical, offensive, plagiarized, or incorrect will be penalized.

Syllabus Fall 2024 93.830 Technologies Transforming Arts Enterprises
Collaboration and discussion around the projects will be frequent and common during class only . Your
hands-on experiments should be with your partners only, while your weekly news, rabbit holes, and
reflections are solo.

In addition to the guidelines concerning work materials, you are expected to behave in a supportive and
professional manner towards your colleagues/classmates; this includes sharing resources for mutual
benefit, protecting information told in confidence, and helping to create a general classroom climate of
honesty and respect.

Respect and Support
In addition to the guidelines concerning work materials, you are expected to behave in a supportive and
professional manner towards your colleagues/classmates; this includes sharing resources for mutual
benefit, protecting information told in confidence, and helping to create a general classroom climate of
honesty and respect.

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds, identities, and perspectives be well served by
this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity
that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. Your suggestions are
encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for
you personally or for other students or student groups. In addition, if any of our class meetings conflict
with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements for you.

All people have the right to be addressed and referred to in accordance with their personal identity. In
this class, we will have the chance to indicate the name that we prefer to be called and the pronouns by
which should be used to refer to us. I will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly and
support classmates in doing so as well.

To support this framework, all in the class will agree to a set of Inclusive Behavior tenets as shared on
Canvas. If you do not agree or have suggestions for improvement, please contact the professor as soon
as possible.
### Special Needs and Interests

My goal is to provide the most effective educational atmosphere for all students. Please let me know, in
confidence, early in the semester if you have any special needs (broadly defined). Also note that the
university provides significant support should you find yourself struggling with time management,
writing or other practical concerns. Please avail yourself of the Student Success Center .

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well,
exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help
you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful
resources available on campus, and an important part of a professional education experience is learning
how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety
or depression, please seek support or help your peer do so. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS)
Syllabus Fall 2024 93.830 Technologies Transforming Arts Enterprises
is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/ . Consider
reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support
that can help.
