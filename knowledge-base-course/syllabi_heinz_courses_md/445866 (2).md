Office Hours: by appointment â€“ email to schedule
Class Schedule: Monday & Wednesday 9:30-10:50am, HbH 1006
Objectives: This seminar is intended for all first-year PhD students in the Heinz
College. Its purpose is to introduce first-year students to the research process and to
bring them into the intellectual community at Heinz. The seminar includes presentations
by Heinz College faculty, student presentations of existing research, and presentations
from second-year Heinz College Ph.D. students. Through these experiences, students
will
### *  Become familiar with the kinds of research being done at Heinz

### *  Find faculty and students with similar research interests

### *  Understand the unseen steps (and missteps) along the way to a published paper

### *  Experience presenting technical research to a diverse audience

### *  Learn to provide helpful feedback on research presentations

Course Organization: The course consists of three main modules and an additional set
of professional practice work.
## 1. Faculty Presentations

Heinz College faculty members will present one of their research papers to the class.

These presentations will focus on the research process, rather than the product, as one
would in a standard research seminar presentation. The faculty will address how they
developed the idea; how they implemented the research, including missteps and
unforeseen challenges; how they decided how to present the work; and/or how they dealt
with the publication process. These presentations are intended to expose students to the
very diverse members of the Heinz College faculty so that they can see whose research
topics and research approaches most interest them.

For each speaker, students will be expected to have carefully read the paper before class
and to engage with the speaker during their guest lecture. Regular preparation and
participation will determine the grading for this portion of the course.

## 2. Student Presentations

In the second portion of the course, students will present existing research papers to the
class. The papers may be drawn from Heinz College faculty or other researchers and
reflect diverse approaches to producing research that has real-world impact on policy,
business, and society. Your goal is to help your classmates understand 1) what is the
research question being answered by the paper, 2) why is this question important, and
who benefits from answering it, and 3) what do we learn from the paper that can
influence policy, business, or society more generally.

These presentations will give students the opportunity to practice presenting technical
research quickly and clearly to an interdisciplinary audience. The papers will help
highlight the ways in which different styles of research can have real-world impact and
will demonstrate how different fields emphasize different styles of research.

Students will choose a paper to present, subject to my approval, and presentations will
last for 30 minutes. I will be available to help with presentation preparation.
## 3. Second-year PhD Student Presentations

In the final portion of the course, students in the second year of the Heinz PhD program
will present their first paper research. This paper is due by the end of the second year,
and the presentation to our Seminar is an important step in preparing for the formal
presentation in the following semester. Your role will be to provide concise, clear,
constructive feedback to each presenter within two days of the presentation. Working
together with other students to improve research and presentations is an essential part of
the graduate school experience, and this will be an opportunity to get started with that
practice.
## 4. Professional Practices

a. Participate in Heinz Informal Seminar and the Monday Seminar series as
scheduled
b. Provide a list of publication outlets and conferences that you plan to pursue
during your graduate school career and beyond. This will be field- and topicspecific, so you will need to work with your advisor and other students to prepare
this list.
c. Investigate and sign up for one or more table-of-contents or working paper series
email alert services, relevant to your research area.

### Policies:

Please turn off your cell phone while in the classroom (talk to me if you have a special
situation requiring constant communication).

Attendance is required.

All materials related to presentations will be posted on the CMU Canvas website
(www.cmu.edu/canvas). As speakers are assigned to specific dates, the schedule
document on Canvas will be updated accordingly.

If you have a disability and are registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I
encourage you to use their online system to notify me of your accommodations and
discuss your needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to
ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may
have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with
the Office of Disability Resources, we encourage you to contact them
at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Especially in these trying times it is important that you Take care of yourself. Do your
best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding
drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help
you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or
feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.
