Course Description
This course will go beyond the basics introduced in External Relations: Fundraising & Individual Giving
and External Relations: Fundraising & Institutional Giving, and cover a number of special topics including
fundraising campaigns, planned giving, special events, the use of fundraising consultants, and the
creation of a development plan. In smaller organizations, every member of the development office
likely needs to have at least a passing familiarity with these topics. In a larger organization, you might
be in a position focused on only one area. In either case, having an understanding of these topics and
the strategies that inform their use will be a valuable tool. In each section, we may hear from experts
in that particular discipline to provide context based on their own experiences.

Prerequisites
Course 93-826, External Relations: Fundraising & Individual Giving
Course 93-827, External Relations: Fundraising & Institutional Giving
Course Objectives
By the end of this course you will understand the basic principles of a number of specific topics in
fundraising. Specific learning objectives include:
● Classify the different types of fundraising campaigns, planned gifts, special events, major
gifts, and assess their place in an overall development plan.
● Illustrate the reasons why a non-profit organization might choose to utilize a fundraising
consultant and list the services that may be provided.
● Formulate a compelling Case for Support in anticipation of a fundraising campaign or as
part of ongoing fundraising solicitations.
● Define the needed relationships between development and institutional staff, board
members, and other volunteers to make a campaign successful.
● State the major types of planned giving vehicles and explain how a fundraiser works to
incorporate them into a development program.
### Advanced Topics in Fundraising

Micro Mini, Fall 2024 (Syllabus Updated: 11/1/24)
● Compare the different kinds of special events that happen in fundraising programs, explain
how are they planned, and devise a formula to determine their return on investment (ROI).
● Demonstrate how to incorporate the different components of fundraising into a
comprehensive organizational development plan.

Course Requirements
Please see the end of the syllabus for assigned reading in advance of both course meeting
sessions as well as additional optional readings needed to complete assignments.

This micro-mini course will be structured as if the class were a functional development office in an
arts nonprofit with the instructors serving as Chief Development Officers. Students will complete
components of a development plan incorporating some or all of the following principles:
● Annual Giving forms the basis of the donor pyramid and is the foundation on which the
rest of the fundraising plan is built.
● Major Gifts from individual, corporate, and foundation donors can be used to support
specific projects within an organization’s overall goals at a higher level than the typical
annual fund contribution. However, they also require more personalized approach.
● Special Events may have different goals for your organization: fundraising, friend-raising,
donor cultivation, community awareness, or others. We will discuss the different kinds of
events that an organization might plan, the reasons to do an event or not do an event, and
how to assess the impact and ROI of an event.
● Fundraising Campaigns are the most efficient and cost effective way to raise significant
funds for a particular need in a relatively short period of time. They are also a lot of work
and require significant focus from organizational staff, board members, and community
supporters. We will explore the different types of campaigns, why an organization might
choose to start a campaign, the timetable and organizational structure necessary for success,
and how to set a financial goal.
● Planned Giving described the process for a gift that a donor makes as part of their estate
planning or their will. Although the most common planned gift is a simple bequest there are
other types of gifts as well. We will also discuss ways to discuss planned giving with your
donors and how to start a planned giving program in your organization.

Students (in pairs) will meet with one instructor for a 1-hour, two-on-one videoconference about
their portion of the overall objective, some of the optional readings, and the class goal of creating a
development plan. Assignment: 250-300 words briefly summarizing two of the optional
readings and posing 2-3 questions for discussion, due to both instructors by email 24 hours
before assigned 1-1 meeting time
### Working as a group, the class will then complete the following sections of the development plan:

### ● Case for Support and Key Messages

● Timetable/Calendar
### ● Strategic and Financial Goals

### Advanced Topics in Fundraising

Micro Mini, Fall 2024 (Syllabus Updated: 11/1/24)
Students will then write a description of how development planning could have a direct impact on a
non-profit organization with which they are familiar, based on best practices discussed in the course.

Please cover at least three of the following areas: annual giving, major gifts, special events, a
fundraising campaign, or planned giving. Students are recommended to read textbook Chapter 9.

Assignment: 1250-1750 words, due to both instructors by email by 5pm on Monday,
December 2, 2024
Preparation for Class: Completing the assigned reading before class is essential to ensure that
everyone is starting on the same page for our conversation. Since this is a graduate level course, we
will assume that you have done the reading and will come to class prepared to engage in discussion.

Attendance: You are required to attend all class sessions. If you have a need to miss class or are ill,
we would appreciate an email as far in advance as possible. Make up work may be assigned at the
instructor’s discretion and your participation grade may be lowered if you are not in class without a
valid reason. Given the COVID-19 pandemic situation, we will be as flexible as possible in this
regard.

Class Participation: This course will be a seminar style classroom and every student will contribute
to the learning process for every other student at some point during the term. Therefore, active
participation in class assignments and discussions, as well as asking questions of guest speakers, is
essential for success in this course.

Micro Mini, Fall 2024 (Syllabus Updated: 11/1/24)
Electronic Devices: If you wish to take notes on a laptop during class that is acceptable; the
instructors will notice if you appear distracted by non-academic matters. Aside from this, phones and
other devices should be stowed away during class.

Food and Drink in Class: Studies show that adult learners do well if refreshments are available.

Please feel free to bring food or drink to class; please clean up after yourself.

Recording: Course sessions will be audio/video recorded for educational use by other students in
this course. These recordings are for the use of the students in this course only and should not be
shared with others.

Cheating and Plagiarism: Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as
extremely serious matters. Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as
among the most serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a
required paper or as cheating on an examination, including take-home as well as in-class
examinations. The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the MAM program and
Heinz College.
### Cheating includes but is not necessarily limited to:

● Plagiarism, explained below.
● Submission of work that is not the student's own for papers, assignments or exams.
● Submission or use of falsified data.
● Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam.
● Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination.
● Use of unauthorized material including textbooks, notes or computer programs in the
preparation of an assignment or during an examination.
● Supplying or communicating in any way unauthorized information to another student for the
preparation of an assignment or during an examination.
● Collaboration in the preparation of an assignment. Unless specifically permitted or required
by the instructor, collaboration will usually be viewed by the university as cheating. Each
student, therefore, is responsible for understanding the policies of the department offering
any course as they refer to the amount of help and collaboration permitted in preparation of
assignments.
● Submission of the same work for credit in two courses without obtaining the permission of
the instructors beforehand.

Plagiarism is the failure to indicate the source of work – either with quotation marks or footnotes.

The source can be a phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific language, or an idea derived from the
work of another person. Note that material on the web is another person’s work and is therefore
equally subject to the rules on plagiarism and cheating as any other source material.

You are welcome to use generative AI programs (ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc.) in this course. These
programs can be powerful tools for learning and other productive pursuits, including completing
some assignments in less time, helping you generate new ideas, or serving as a personalized learning
tool.

However, your ethical responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow CMU’s
academic integrity policy. Note that this policy applies to all uncited or improperly cited use of
content, whether that work is created by human beings alone or in collaboration with a generative
AI. If you use a generative AI tool to develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite the
### Advanced Topics in Fundraising

Micro Mini, Fall 2024 (Syllabus Updated: 11/1/24)
tool’s contribution to your work. In practice, cutting and pasting content from any source without
citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing content from a generative AI without citation is
plagiarism. Similarly, using any generative AI tool without appropriate acknowledgement will be
treated as plagiarism.
### Here are some specific expectations for your use of AI generation tools in this course:

### *  You can include AI generated content verbatim into a writing assignment with quotations

and a citation.
*  You can paraphrase AI generated content with a citation.
*  You can include non-text AI generated content (images, video, code, etc.) with an
appropriate citation, when expressly permitted in the assignment prompt.
### *  You will conduct your own research and generate bibliographies yourself for topics that you

have researched.
*  You will not use or present generative AI content that you pass off as your own work.

Finally, it is important that you recognize that generative AI tools frequently provide users with
incorrect information, create professional-looking citations that are not real, generate contradictory
statements, incorporate copyrighted material without appropriate attribution, and sometimes
integrate biased or offensive concepts. Code generation models may produce inaccurate outputs.

Image generation models may create misleading or offensive content.

While you may use these tools in the work you create for this class, it is important to note that you
understand you are ultimately responsible for the content that you submit. Work that is
inaccurate, biased, unethical, offensive, plagiarized, or incorrect will be treated as such during the
evaluation of your work.

Cheating and/or plagiarism on an assignment will result in a failing grade (zero points) for
that assignment. The assignment in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the
offending student’s assignments included in grade calculations; the points for that piece of work –
zero (0) – will be factored into the grade. Furthermore, the cheating student’s final grade will be
reduced one full letter grade. A cheating student’s final grade will be impacted significantly. In
addition, all cases of cheating and plagiarism are submitted to and reviewed by the Dean’s Office,
which reserves the right to impose more severe penalties, up to and including expulsion from the
Heinz School.

Statement on Diversity
We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is
fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity
can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national
origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry,
belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others
not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We,
at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels
excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections
while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and
sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional.
### Advanced Topics in Fundraising

Micro Mini, Fall 2024 (Syllabus Updated: 11/1/24)
They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the
university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile
treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the
incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following
resources:
*  Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
*  Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a report by
calling 844-587-0793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com.

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions.

Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus
climate to be more equitable and just.

Food Insecurity
If you are worried about affording food or feeling insecure about food, there are resources on
campus that can help. Any undergraduate or graduate student can visit the CMU Pantry and receive
food for free. Follow the directions on the CMU Pantry website to schedule your visit.
