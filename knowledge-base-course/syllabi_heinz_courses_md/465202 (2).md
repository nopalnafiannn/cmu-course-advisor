The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the theory and practice of how government finances
itself from both positive and normative points of view.1 To accomplish this, the course reviews rationales for government
intervention in the marketplace, analyzes methods of resolving conflicts2 over the size of the public sector’s budget,
extensively analyzes the rationales and issues of various sources of public revenue, and reviews the effects of public sector
spending and taxes on the aggregate economy. While the examples are largely drawn from the United States, examples
will be used from other industrial democracies and non-democracies. The positive and normative frameworks in public
finance, coupled with many examples, help organize one’s thinking about the modern public sector and its interactions
with the private and non-profit sectors.

Because the subject matter of public spending and revenues can easily consume an entire academic year of study,
Public Finance focuses mainly on the revenue side of the public budget. Two courses typically offered by Professor Strauss
in the spring build on Public Finance; Cost-Benefit Analysis: A Capital Budgeting Approach (90-749) deals with
techniques for evaluating private and public expenditure and capital spending decisions. Education Finance and Policy
(90-817) deals in-depth with issues surrounding multi-level government finance with a focus on education finance from
U.S. and international perspectives. Education Finance and Policy presumes the material covered in Public Finance, so
students interested in taking Education Finance and Policy should take Public Finance. It is suggested that students
interested in Cost-Benefit Analysis: A Capital Budgeting Approach also take Public Finance. Students who do this get
good jobs in the public, private, and non-profit sectors3.

1 Wikipedia states: “ In economics, positive analysis is an attempt to understand the world without value judgments, while normative analysis
uses value judgments. Positive statements are descriptive and factual, and they describe the world as it is. Normative statements are
prescriptive and express value judgments, and they describe the world as it should be. Positive statements can be tested and verified, while
normative statements are based on judgments that are either good or bad”
2 Please look over https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rs9f/overview_6_25_2021.pdf which explains how conflict is resolved in a democracy.
3 Students taking at least one of my three courses have secured jobs at: Deloitte-Touche, Grant Street Associates, Federated Investors,
the American Enterprise Institute (2), Bloomberg (Hong Kong), Google(Hong Kong), Pennsylvania’s Local Management Fellowship among
others. Some have gone on to doctoral programs in economics at Tepper, Michigan State University; political science at the University of
Rochester, and environmental policy at EPP. Also, my former students have also demonstrated strong career trajectories. Dan Hassell was
until his retirement Pennsylvania’s Secretary of Revenue; John Raymond was until his retirement Pennsylvania’s Deputy Secretary of the
Budget; Natalie Krug is Director of Pa. Governor’s Shapiro’s Office of Policy; Shawn Buckner, formerly Director of Policy and Planning for
the US Department of the Interior is now an Officer of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, and Director of the newly
established Strategic Planning Group for the Board’s Office of Statistics and Policy; Roger Severino, former Director of HSS’ Office of Civil
Rights is currently Assistant Director for Domestic Policy at the Heritage Foundaton; Chris Berdnik is Chief Financial Officer of the
Pennsbury School District; Laney Morrison is Chief Data Scientist for HHS, and William Joraskie is the lead analyst for the Pennsylvania
Senate Appropriations Committee (R). Doctoral students of mine have gone on to academic careers at Duke, Texas A&M, University of
Illinois-Springfield, University of Virginia, University of Georgia, as well as public service careers at the US Bureau of Labor. Praxtixa Desai
just accepted the offer from California Governor Newsom to the position of Director of Housing Finance.
4 I strongly recommend reading the front page of FT each morning to become aware of national and international events.

access to the CMU internet environment (Andrew.cmu.edu)5
*  10 Strauss Bucks which you should print out and cut out with a scissors and are stored on Canvas
### *  An external USB drive of at least several gigabytes on which you can store data and results for problem sets

Periodically students ask me if there is a more basic public finance text that they can read in conjunction with
Musgrave and Musgrave. Harvey Rosen’s Public Finance is an easy read that is more current that you may find helpful.

In addition, it is strongly recommended that you read the front page of The Wall Street Journal or Financial Times in
order to keep abreast of economic, financial and fiscal events, subscribe to the free news feeds of Bloomberg and the
Wall Street Journal’s Real Time Economics. The Wall Street Journal is available through the CMU library portal. Also,
thanks to the largesse of Hunt Library, by taking this course you will be able to also have access to the Financial Times.

Go to http://ft.com/cmu and establish your free account with your Andrew credentials.

My general goal in public finance is to improve your ability to think analytically, and to draw conclusions from
data/statistical results about how such facts relate to the widely accepted goals of a good tax system (efficiency, vertical
and horizontal equity, administrative feasibility, revenue predictability and revenue productivity). Since taxation
inherently involves taking resources from people and spending them through the public budget, and giving up resources
for that purpose can readily be controversial, we will pay a great deal of attention to words used to accomplish both
taking and spending. Students my find this level of focus unusual, as they may find the Socratic method of teaching
which I use---I pose questions to students about course topics and expect them to provide answers on the fly to
precipitate learning, and develop the capability of looking at a public sector problem from varying perspectives.

The format of the course is lecture/discussion [in English]. Students are encouraged to ask questions by proceeding as
follows: 1) the interested student will raise his/her hand to be recognized by me, and then 2), if so recognized, will be
invited to ask their question or answer a posed question/make a comment. Students who ask that the obvious be
explained or simply make speeches and filibuster will not be recognized for comment. The use of a statement by any
student that begins with “I feel like…” is strongly discouraged, as is the use of circular reasoning. (See:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning )
Please be advised that Public Finance prohibits the use of generative AI to answer homework or exam questions.

The Musgrave and Musgrave text (MM), which is free and available in the Canvas course environment is self-explanatory
but extremely terse; the text and footnotes require careful reading. Lectures will typically involve elaboration of key points in
the text, contain complementary examples drawn from the real world, and empirical material that I routinely accumulate. Each
lecture/discussion session is designed to bring together the world of theory and the world of actual public financial practice,
and to develop each student’s analytical skills in the domain of public finance. Students are encouraged to have read the lecture
outlines, assigned required reading material prior to lecture and will be asked questions about the assigned material. Because
some of the statutory details about tax instruments have changed since the text was written, current institutional information is
contained in Canvas and/or explained in lecture. For example, we will look at current federal tax return forms as a lens through
which to see how taxation actually functions.

The course has been designed so that the student synthesizes the theory and institutions that are provided in the textbook
and lectures, while the problem sets are designed to provide meaningful professional experiences for each segment of the
course. Student learning takes place as a result of this synthesizing process and will help students learn how to think more
clearly and thereby not be replaced by generative AI. Please be sure to take the time requirements of the course and problem
sets seriously. That is, the course is a full semester 12 unit course which means that you are expected to devote 12 hours/week
to the course which is composed of attending class, 3 hours/week, doing the reading and the homework.

We will be using Canvas for a variety of purposes. You access it by setting your browser to
www.cmu.edu/canvas.
5 On Canvas you will find recommendations for software to put on your Windows or Mac laptop for terminal emulation
and secure file Transfer. I also highly recommend you install VSCODE editor from the CMU Software portal as soon as possible.

You will be asked in class 8/26/2024 whether or not you have read the software/hardware recommendations and accomplished
the install of terminal emulation, file transfer, and VSCODE packages.

If feasible, class sessions will be recorded, and your attendance is required. We convene in Hamburg Hall 2011 for
class sessions. Class will always be held Monday and Wednesday and sometimes on Friday. The exact schedule is below
with occasional Friday sessions noted. On Friday August 30, the class will meet for a presentation by Hunt Social Science
Reference Librarian, Ms. Sarah Young, about course resources pertinent to public finance and available at Hunt Library;
she will do this via a recorded Zoom session. There will be a SAS tutorial on at least one Friday (September 6), and
Friday review sessions in the 3:30--4:50 PM time slot, or an occasional makeup or catch-up class if we are unable to meet
M or W. These Friday sessions will be held on Friday from 3:30-4:50PM on the same basis as regular classes MW.

There will be occasional guest luncheon speakers (noon to 1pm) who are distinguished practitioners in areas related
to this course; Attendance is Required.

Dr. Stuart Hoffman, emeritus Chief Economist of PNC will give his annual lecture on the economic outlook;
Monday September 30 from noon to 1PM; room to be announced. This is a confirmed speaker, so plan
accordingly.
### Other possible speakers include:

## 1. Dr. Wendell Primus, former direct report to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (now at Brookings)

## 2. Dr. Mark Mazur, retired, former Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, US Treasury; former Director of Statistics,

EPA; former Director of Research IRS; former Director of Brookings-Urban Institute Tax Policy Center
[and former SUPA faculty member]
## 3. Dr. Bobby Conrad, my former undergraduate student at UNC, co-author, former Director of Central and Eastern

Europe Technical Assistance Office of the US Treasury, and retired professor from Duke’s Sanford School of
Public Policy;
## 4. Dr. Kathleen Peroff, retired from OMB after being the top senior civil servant in charge of the budgets of the

US Department of Defense and the 14 US national security agencies (CIA, NSA, DIA etc.) has agreed to give
a talk. She has 5 Presidential Awards during her 35 years at OMB, compared to my 2 presidential pens in 5
years of federal service.
## 5. Dr. Prodipto Ghosh, Retired Cabinet Secretary of the Interior, Government of India.

Office hours are before class Monday and Wednesday from 2-3:15 PM MWF, either in person or via Zoom, and
appointment. If any issues arise which you want to discuss, I’m happy to do so privately. It’s easy to communicate with me
via email (rpstrauss@gmail.com or RS9F@Andrew.cmu.edu ) as I am usually logged in from somewhere in the world around
the clock.

Evaluation of student performance is based on written essay examinations, problem sets, class participation.

Answers to each of the problem sets must be word processed, and must contain written, verbal explanations of all
numerical results. Problem sets 2-7 are to be turned in via email in MS Word form. Handwritten answers to problem sets
will NOT be accepted. Problem sets 2, 3, 5, and 6 are to be worked on and answered separately and independently by
each student. Problem Sets 1, 4, and 7 may be completed in groups. Again, use of Generative AI is prohibited.

There will be three short-answer, written examinations: at six weeks, at twelve weeks, and at the end of the semester worth
respectively 20%, 20%, and 30%. You may drop the lowest score of the two midterm exams and the respective weights then
become 35% for each exam. The final examination will cover the entire course and must be taken, while the two mid-term
exams will cover the material in the immediately preceding six weeks. There are seven problem sets, each worth 4%. You may
drop the lowest problem set score if you wish so that t h e 6 t ha t are counted are wo r t h 28 / 6 = 4
.667 % each.
### All problem sets MUST be word processed, and sent to me via email at rpstrauss@gmail.com using the syntax:

Your last name_first_name_problem set or exam number_date and a suffix of .doc.

### Example:

Class participation is worth 3%. If you do not attend class, [which means are in your seat and continuously in the classroom until the
end of class], you will be penalized.

If you believe that you have been unfairly graded, the procedure for appealing a grade is to put a post-it with a request for
re-grading on a printed version of the evaluation [problem set or exam] and give it to me; I will re-grade it privately and return
it to you with the revision, if any, in your grade. Please be advised that in submitting a problem set or exam for regarding, I
reserve the right to re-grade other parts of it.

The grading scale, stated in Points, is: A+
> 100.0
A 95.0-100.

A- 90-94.9
B+ 85.0-89.9
B 80.0-84.9
B- 75.0-79.9
C+ 70.0-74.9
C 65.0-69.9
C- 60.0-64.9
D+ 55.0-59.9
D- 50-54.9
R < 49.9
Pass/Fail 70 or better
Finally, a few reminders about decorum, and classroom procedures.

First, there is a no-touching rule in class. This will be explained in class.

Second, there is a no-eating rule. Coffee, water, soft drinks only.

Third, there is a prohibition against engaging in texting, using a cell phone or other kinds of non-academic conduct during each class
session.
### This also means there is a prohibition against watching movies or other kinds of non-public finance entertainment. More specifically:

Portable or cellular telephones, beepers, pagers, televisions, radios, hand-held video games, iPods, other MP3 players, CD, radio headsets, and
virtual reality headsets (for non-public finance use) are not permitted for use in the classroom. Laptops, notebooks etc., and other electronic
devices are only for note taking related to the class, and are permitted.

Any student who uses his/her laptop etc. in class for emailing, Instant Messaging, music, browsing the net etc. on matters unrelated to the
course will be asked to leave the classroom. Since class lecture outlines and associated required and optional readings are provided via
Canvas, you are best advised to have read them ahead of time.

Fourth, students, of any gender are expected to dress and conduct themselves professionally; and
Fifth, the class begins promptly at 3:30 PM Eastern Standard Time which is based on my Fitbit Ionic watch which is synched
via an atomic clock somewhere on the internet, and is the official arbiter of what time it is. I may lock the classroom door to
encourage timely attendance. Each class will begin with a review of the day’s agenda, AND the recitation of the course
chant. Each student will be asked to recite one of the assigned course chant:
## 1. Does the duration of the policy match the duration of the financing?

## 2. Who is the taxpayer?

## 3. What is being taxed?

5 of 9
© Robert P. Strauss 2024

## 4. How much is ‘it’ being taxed?

## 5. Where is ‘it’ being taxed;

## 6. When is ‘it’ being taxed?

## 7. What are the privacy assurances surrounding taxation?

## 8. Why is it being taxed? Income as barometer to finance services?

## 9. What are the financial and personal liberty consequences of various answers to the questions 1-7

Students are expected to be ready for the class on or before the appointed times, and remain in the class throughout the class
session. While absence from class is not explicitly penalized, (attendance is merely required) other than for attending
mandatory lunch lectures, it is fair to say that attending class will materially improve your learning about public finance, and
better prepare you for exam questions, since topics discussed during class session are, by definition, fair game for being on
any exam. If I ask a question of a student who chooses not to be in the class, I will make note that the student failed to answer
the question. This will be counted in the class-participation portion of his/her grade.
