# PREREQUISITE

You are presumed to have a solid grounding in basic statistics, at the level of 90-707
(Statistical Reasoning), 90-711 (Statistical Reasoning with R), or 90-777 (Intermediate
Statistics). We will make good use of the material covered in those courses.
# READINGS

There is a set of readings from Mastering Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect by
Joshua D. Angrist and Jorn-Steffen Pischke (Princeton University Press, 2015). This is a
relatively simple but sophisticated book. It is fun to read and is also very short (and
inexpensive!). There is also a free short course online (still incomplete) related to the
book: https://mru.org/mastering-econometrics-joshua-angrist. I use some of the short
videos in our course as well – they are posted on Canvas, under “Lectures.” If you like
the style of the book we suggest you follow up with a more advanced book by the same
authors, Mostly Harmless Econometrics (Princeton University Press, 2009). Another
excellent option is the book Causal Inference: The Mixtape (Yale University Press, 2021),
by Scott Cunningham, which is available online at https://mixtape.scunning.com, and
contains examples of codes to implement each methodology in R, Stata, and Python.

You will likely find it useful to have a basic statistics textbook at hand. The book you
used in your preparatory statistics class (90-707, 90-711, 90-777, or similar course) will
be fine. In addition, many of you may find it helpful to have a standard econometrics
textbook available to provide additional material on the topics we are covering. One
good choice is Introduction to Econometrics by James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson
(Pearson). You can buy a used version of the 1st or 2nd edition, which should be quite
inexpensive at this point.
# COURSE CONTENT AND OBJECTIVES

Econometrics has an important place in the data sciences. As your textbook authors
say, the purpose of econometrics is to “untangle cause and effect in human affairs.”
Econometrics is essential for advancing understanding in the social sciences, conducting
public policy evaluation, and assessing the impact of business practice.

Applied Econometrics I is the first course in a two-course sequence designed to teach
the essentials of econometric methodology. You should plan to take both courses.
### During the first course you will:

### *  Learn why random assignment is so useful for the purpose of sorting out cause

and effect.
### *  Develop a clear understanding of bivariate and multiple regression, and come to

appreciate the value and limitations of regression methods.
### *  Acquire an appreciation for the use of instrumental variables for the purpose of

evaluating causality in complex real-world applications.

Applied Econometrics II follows up by pursuing those same topics in additional depth,
and by treating other topics and applications. For instance, in that course you will:
### *  Learn how regression discontinuity is used to draw inferences about causal

effects from rules constraining human behavior.
### *  Use difference-in-differences techniques to study causality when experiments

happen naturally in society.
### *  Apply event study analysis to tackle causal questions when there are multiple

natural experiments, or small sample sizes.

Both Applied Econometrics I and Applied Econometrics II are “hands on” courses in
which you will not only learn to read and interpret existing studies, but will also conduct
econometric analyses of your own. The goal is to help you take your first few steps
toward becoming a “Metrics Master”!
# GRADING AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

Your grade depends on the extent to which you demonstrate the capacity to solve
problems and think critically about econometric practice.

There will be five graded problem sets. You are encouraged to work in groups on the
problem sets (and to visit TAs in groups). While the problems may be worked on in
groups, each of you should submit to Gradescope answers written in your own words.

Problem sets are due by 11:59pm on Fridays. However, as an accommodation, the
lowest assignment grade will be dropped when calculating your final grade.

The final grade is based on two exams (30 percent for the first exam, 38 percent for the
second exam), and problem sets (32 percent).

In-person attendance to all lectures and recitations is expected. Please let your
instructor know in advance if you are unable to attend.

Exams are scheduled for February 10 and February 28. Students may be excused from
exams only if arrangements are made in advance or in the event of an emergency.

A grade of 0 will be assigned for any assignment or exam that does not conform to
University policies regarding academic integrity, and other penalties may also pertain,
including termination from enrollment at Carnegie Mellon. See the Heinz College
Student Handbook.
# CLASS POLICY ON LAPTOPS

Please use laptops in class only when requested by the instructor. For those of you who
like to have typed material, we will provide all lecture slides on Canvas.

COVID-19 PROTOCOL
In order to attend class meetings in person, all students are expected to abide by all
behaviors indicated in https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/students/index.html,
including any timely updates based on the current conditions.

For this course, I will be recording class sessions and making them available to you for
your personal, educational use. Recordings of class sessions are covered under the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and must not be shared with anyone
outside your course-section. The purpose of these recording is so students in this
course (and only students in this course) can watch or re-watch past class sessions. Feel
free to use the recordings if you would like to review something we discussed in class or
if you are temporarily unable to attend class.
# THOUGHTS FOR THE SEMESTER

Your graduate-school experience might prove to be mostly enjoyable and carefree, but
it is likely to entail stress as well. The University Provost provides the following
thoughts for students. They seem very sensible to us:
Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by
eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking
some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are
many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college
experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is
often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or
feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

Counseling and Psychological Services is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their
website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty
or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.

We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this
diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus
community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but
not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual
orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic
information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned
here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at
CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels
excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our
imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our
classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces
these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or
unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals
and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who
experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out
for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has
passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:
Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
Report it online (anonymous reporting platform): http://reportit.net username: tartans
password: plaid
All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any
following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared
experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.
