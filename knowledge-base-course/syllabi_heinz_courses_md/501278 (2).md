Course Description
The success of arts and cultural institutions in the 21st century and beyond will depend upon
creative, unconventional, and coordinated long-range approaches to communicating with their
stakeholders. This is even more true as organizations continue through and emerge from the
circumstances of the global pandemic. Marketing and communication is a core activity of any
arts enterprises work in external relations. It frames and holds together the brand of all
stakeholder communications across earned and contributed income streams (marketing =
earned; development = contributed). Today’s communication professionals are crucial to their
arts organizations; they maintain existing audiences, secure new audiences, create future
donors, and create the brand for the institution. They interact with all aspects of the
organization, from personnel to fundraising.

This course provides readings and professional presentations to guide the understanding of
successful marketing and communication. From an understanding of this thought leadership,
students engage in a project-based method to investigate hands-on the opportunities
addressing the changes within the arts audience and the shifting digital landscape for marketing
the arts in the United States. The focus of the course is marketing and communications within a
nonprofit arts organization, recognizing that the audiences rarely distinguish the difference.

Yet, due to budget AND purpose, marketing not-for-profit arts organizations is significantly
different from a for-profit entertainment venture. This course will provide each student with
marketing principles and theories, as well as opportunities to actualize theories with
assignments and a final project utilizing current technologies.

The course requires active, practical engagement and intellectual rigor.

# COURSE EXPECTATIONS

Engagement
Active class participation is expected. The class will offer opportunities to learn in an active and
synergistic manner. Class time will include discussing assigned readings, and working in a hands-on
application environment to gain proficiency on concepts. Students also engage through oral
presentations and small group sharing of thoughts and ideas. Participation earns you points.

Due to the depth of the content and the limited class time together, this course utilizes the online
teaching system, Canvas, as well as engagement tools, including Google Drive and Miro. Canvas will
provide a venue for easy course announcements, links to reading materials etc, a location to submit
assignments, and grade tracking. NOTE: we are in a tech-heavy, social network world. You will be using
some tools to start building those skills.

Weekly Learning Assessments
There are weekly opportunities for you to earn points by demonstrating mastery of course materials.

These assessments are due by the end of the day on Friday. Three of the assessments are completed
solo, online, open-book worksheet/quiz combinations. The assessment is timed. Three are group
discussions with prompted questions to be held online in assigned groups of 4 – 5 people. You will need
to find time together between Thursday at 3:30pm and Friday at midnight to complete these
assessments. Discussion 1 will be held using a new tool: Breakout Learning which requires a fee of $6. IF
you have any concerns with this fee, please see the professor. Discussion 2 and 3 will be held via a
recorded zoom. Whether solo or discussion, these assessments are designed to help you confirm that
you have grasped the core concepts and can apply them to your final project and, eventually, your
career. There will be no weekly assessment during the last week of class, allowing you to focus on
wrapping up the final project. If you miss a class or are sick, please read the materials and watch any
class recordings provided in Canvas. NO LATE WORK IS ACCEPTED. A zero will be the grade assigned for
that particular assessment. The point is to gain and demonstrate proficiency by working through the
material in class.

Assignments
There are THREE ASSIGNMENTS that serve as drafts of your final project. They are graded and
offered back as feedback for improvement for your final project. The concept is that you
complete them SOLO to create a diversity of ideas to bring to your project group Details are
provided separately on Canvas and due dates are on the schedule below
All assignments apply to your final project for the class. These are typically due on Sundays at 6p.
### Feedback from your TA for every homework assignment will be provided within the week. Late work:

you have a 24-hour grace period submission window to accommodate life conflicts. After the grace
period, late work loses points 1% for every hour (essentially 24% per day)
## 1. Brand Analysis: Summary analysis of the organization you use for your FINAL PROJECT. The

analysis will combine Brandraising’s pyramid and materials (ch 1 - 4): Their Mission, Vision,
Values, Position, and Personality. You will use data and evidence to support your conclusions.

You should turn in an analysis AND develop a Brand Guide that you can use for your project.
## 2. ONE customer persona draft drawn from data as demonstrated in class. The REQUIRED

template is provided in Miro. Models and flows of information to complete the project were
demonstrated in class.
## 3. Press Release and one Feature Article or Interview Pitch opportunity identified with a 30 second

pitch script for a likely identified journalist/blogger/podcaster.
## 4. EXTRA CREDIT: Who and How Advertising Handbook Section. The perk of this assignment is that

the class can use your work for the final project. The extra credit assignment includes a 2minute take-aways presentation video recorded and a thorough 3-5 page document that
explains WHO the advertising path reaches and HOW to place an ad (including cost / rates).

The 3-5 pages should include a one-page list of resources in Chicago style.

Please see the professor / TA to select a Topic. Topics include: How to use ads manager with
Meta+AI, place a digital with partner print advertisement in the Washington Post, advertise on a
bus or bus stop in Washington DC, creating a Snapchat geofilter, etc.

Extra credit is due by Sunday of week 6. (see Canvas)
FINAL PROJECT (groups of 3-4 to be assigned by the professor) is developed the entire mini.

You may submit a draft for feedback on Sunday February 23rd. The final presentation is to be
presented on the last day of class, with an additional day to wrap up the written plan and
attachments.

Throughout the class, you will gather experience and knowledge to work on a project for a real
organization and a real project. You are, essentially, a small consulting firm that has been asked to
consider the organization’s brand and then recommend communication choices for a specific program
coming up this summer or fall. This is a real project coming up in their season with real artists. You are
providing recommendations and opinions supported by evidence and based on data and best practices
from the class.

You will be creating a marketing plan (written less than 10 pages) that includes your suggested strategy
to achieve mission-oriented success. These strategies should include tactics built out on a
communication ‘matrix’. In addition, you will provide THREE suggested customer personas and
journey maps (ONE should be an acquisition target, ONE is a single ticket buyer, ONE is a, One is a
member/subscriber). Your personas should include one of each of the following, as supported by
data: Boomers, Gen X, and Gen Y.

Your final deliverables will be: a) an 8-minute summary presentation to the organization (they may
attend class, and class will be recorded) that presents your personas and communication plan b) a
written complete marketing plan for the exhibition/program/production no more than 7 pages,
single-spaced, with the following attachments: Full articulated Personas, Communication Matrix,
Brand Analysis and Recommendation, Press Release with Feature or Interview Pitch Idea, and a
bibliography of resources.

Reminder: The personas should include demographic, psychographic /affinity and geographic elements
(people purchase paths are most affected by lifestyle and affinity interests). Miro for class has blank
templates for your personas and journey maps). Additional models will be provided in class and on
Canvas. You MUST use the templates provided in Miro. If other templates are used, you will lose 25% for
that component of the assignment.

The slide deck outline for the presentation should include (template provided)
1) Summary of your client and the event (one slide each)
2) Overview of their brand identity
3) Opportunities and Risks for the event
4) A 4-slide bundle for EACH persona including
a. the persona,
b. the journey, and
c. the data underscoring the choices.
d. Overview of the communication plan for each persona,
5) A slide with the 6-week communication plan summary with advertising budget concerns. This
should include brand communications + your plan to reach EACH persona.

During the first week of class, you pick your organization project from a list provided. The 2nd week of
class you will start your project with your assigned team. The class is designed to build the project
slowly. A draft of your final project is due to the professor (optional) the Sunday before the last week of
class as well as the actual final draft for peer feedback on the Tuesday of the last week of class. . You
can then take that feedback and make any adjustments. The presentation will be made to the clients
and the class on Thursday, February 27. The final document is due by midnight on Friday.

### Research to Improve the Course

For this class, your instructor is conducting research on educational outcomes. This research
will involve your coursework. You will not be asked to do anything above and beyond the
normal learning activities and assignments that are part of this course. You are free not to
participate in this research, and your participation will have no influence on your grade for this
course or your academic career at CMU. If you do not wish to participate or if you are under 18
years of age, please send an email to Chad Hershock (hershock@andrew.cmu.edu), and then
your data will not be included. Participants will not receive any compensation. The data
collected as part of this research will include student grades. All analyses of data from
participants’ coursework will be conducted after the course is over and final grades are
submitted. In the future, once we have removed all identifiable information from your data, we
may use the data for our future research studies, or we may distribute the data to other
researchers for their research studies. The Eberly Center may provide support on this research

from this course containing your personal identifiers. All data will be analyzed in de-identified
form and presented in the aggregate, without any personal identifiers. If you have questions
pertaining to your rights as a research participant, or to report concerns to this study, please
contact Chad Hershock (hershock@andrew.cmu.edu).
### Course & Classroom Policies and Expectations

Food/Drink. You are permitted to eat and drink in class as long as you do not disrupt others in the class
and, of course, clean up and dispose of any trash after class.

Cell Phones. keep them in your bag
Computers. Computers or Ipads are required during class., Tablets preferred. HOWEVER, they are
designed to be distraction magnets, so please use them ONLY as directed in class to support your own
learning. Recommended: FOCUS MODE
(instructions for Mac
Instructions for Ipad
Instructions for PC)
### Intellectual and Professional Integrity

This course is an integral part of your graduate education, an education that is designed to provide you
with the tools for a successful, professional career. Assumed within is a high standard of ethics and
integrity. You are expected to have read and understood the Student Handbook. Plagiarism and other
forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely serious matters. Misrepresentation of
another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious violations. Cases of
cheating and plagiarism will receive a grade of zero and, per requirements, be submitted to and
reviewed by the Dean’s Office, where more severe penalties may be imposed, up to and including
expulsion from the Heinz School. If any academic integrity violation occurs during this course, the
assignment will receive a zero for all those involved and the violation will be reported to the Dean of
Heinz College and CMU Office of Students.

Collaboration and discussion around the projects and organizations will be frequent and common during
class. Be respectful of other ideas – let your peers do their thing, you do yours.

Artificial Intelligence
AI will be introduced and may be used as a component of the course, but any use of AI in your work
must be indicated clearly as a citation (Chicago Style) and attachments, including the tool, prompts, and
how you incorporated it. If your AI work is not indicated or cited, that is plagiarism and will be treated
according to the parameters identified above.

Respect and Support
In addition to the guidelines concerning work materials, you are expected to behave in a supportive and
professional manner towards your colleagues/classmates; this includes sharing resources for mutual
benefit, protecting information told in confidence, and helping to create a general classroom climate of
honesty and respect.

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds, identities, and perspectives be well served by
this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity
that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. Your suggestions are
encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for
you personally or for other students or student groups. In addition, if any of our class meetings conflict
with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements for you.

All people have the right to be addressed and referred to in accordance with their personal identity. In
this class, we will have the chance to indicate the name that we prefer to be called and the pronouns by
which should be used to refer to us. I will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly and
support classmates in doing so as well.

To support this framework, we will review a set of Inclusive Behavior tenets at the start of the class.
### Special Needs and Interests

My goal is to provide the most effective educational atmosphere for all students. Please let me know, in
confidence, early in the semester if you have any special needs (broadly defined). Also note that the
university provides significant support should you find yourself struggling with writing, time
management, etc via the Student Success Center.

Take care of yourself.

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding
drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you
achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful
resources available on campus and an important part of a professional education experience is learning
how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety
or depression, please seek support or help your peer do so. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS)
is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider
reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support
that can help.
