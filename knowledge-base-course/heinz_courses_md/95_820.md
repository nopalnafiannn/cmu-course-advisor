# 95-820: Applications of NL(X) and LLM

## Course Information

**Units:** 6

## Description

The rapid adoption of Generative AI technologies is reshaping industries across the globe, from healthcare to financial services. According to Bain & Company, 87% of companies were already developing, piloting, or deploying generative AI by the start of 2024. Moreover, McKinsey's research estimates that generative AI could contribute an additional $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across various sectors. These figures underscore the urgent need for professionals equipped with specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing and Understanding (NL(X)) and Large Language Models (LLMs). This course is designed to provide graduate-level students with a comprehensive understanding of NL(X) and LLMs, focusing on their applications, evaluation, and operationalization across diverse industries. Beginning with the fundamentals of NL(X), the course covers its history, evolution, and critical applications, offering students hands-on experience with essential tools such as text mining, sentiment analysis, and embeddings. As studentsâ€™ progress, they will delve into advanced architectures, including RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers, learning how these models drive key applications like machine translation and named entity recognition (NER). The course places significant emphasis on Large Language Models, such as GPT and BERT, guiding students through the intricacies of training, fine-tuning, and deploying these models. Advanced topics like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic architectures will also be explored, highlighting how LLM-based agents are transforming tasks that require complex reasoning, planning, and execution. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, the course offers detailed instruction on LLMOps, covering best practices for transitioning models from development to production. This includes a strong focus on ethical considerations, operational risks, and the optimization of model performance in enterprise settings. Students will also benefit from guest lectures by industry professionals, providing valuable insights into the practical challenges and opportunities of applying NL(X) and LLMs in real-world environments. These sessions are designed to help students connect their academic learning with industry needs, preparing them to lead in the fast-evolving field of AI. Given the accelerating adoption of Generative AI, this course is essential for those aspiring to roles as NLP engineers, data scientists, AI analysts, or professionals looking to leverage LLMs to drive innovation. By the end of the course, students will possess the critical skills and knowledge required to develop, evaluate, and deploy advanced NL(X) and LLM solutions, positioning themselves at the forefront of AI-driven transformation.
