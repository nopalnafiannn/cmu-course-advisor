# Spring, 2024: 90-775 Decision & Risk Modeling
### Schedule:

## Section A: Tuesday, Thursday 2:00 – 3:20 PM in HbH 2008

## Section B: Tuesday, Thursday 3:30 – 4:50 PM in HbH 2008

Recitation (for both sections): Friday 9:30 – 10:50 AM in A301
Please attend your assigned section. If you have an occasional reason for needing to
attend a different section (e.g., a job interview), let me know but that’s usually fine. If
you have an ongoing reason for needing to switch sections, see me ASAP.

In addition to the final exam during finals week, there will be a midterm
administered during Friday morning recitation on April 11th. Both exams are
required and make-ups will not be allowed except under extraordinary
circumstances.

All other recitations are optional. In them, I will typically work problems and cases,
stressing managerial interpretation.

Instructor: Jon Caulkins, caulkins@andrew.cmu.edu. Office: HbH 2219
Office Hours: Tuesdays & Thursdays 11:00 – 12:00 PM & Fridays 12:30 – 1:30 PM.
### TA’s:

# TBD

Note: TA’s work specific hours. Outside those hours, they are just students like you, with
their own deadlines and classes to worry about. Do not expect TA’s to be “on duty”
whenever and wherever you see them.
### Prerequisites:

College pre-calculus and 90-755 or 90-722, including fluency graphing and
interpreting linear and nonlinear functions.

Ability to work fluently with concepts from probability including the Binomial and
Normal random variables, distributions more generally, computation of mean & standard
deviation, event probabilities, and Bayes Rule. Some concepts in 90-775 are easier to grasp
if one knows regression, but regression per se is not a prerequisite.

The course uses Excel intensively. If you have not become proficient with Excel
in some other way, you should work through some Excel tutorials before the course begins.
### Course Objectives:

This course is one of several introductory courses in analytics and management science
that survey a variety of hands-on quantitative modeling methods that are useful to decision
makers and business and policy analysts. They overlap considerably, but are tailored for
particular programs based on student career paths and interests. You cannot take courses
from more than one of these sequences because they overlap so much.
*  MSPPM, MS3, and PPM-DC students take two minis: Management Science I and II (90722, 90-760) in spring of Year 1.
### *  PPM-DA & HCAIT students take:

o Optimization (90-755) and Decision & Risk Modeling (90-775) in spring of Yr 1.
o Decision Analytics for Business and Policy (94-867) in Year 2.
*  MISM students take one mini: Decision Making Under Uncertainty (95-760).

Students in all three of those tracks, as well as the Army-BIDA program, are invited to take
# 94-833 Multicriteria Decision Making & Decision Analysis as an elective, which covers a

different but complementary set of managerial decision tools.

The 90-755/90-775/94-867 sequence has six objectives.

First, you should learn about a variety of management science techniques, what
they are capable of, and what their limitations are so that you can intelligently call upon
specialists and consultants when the occasion arises. (90-755/90-775)
Second, you should become facile at building and analyzing models in both Excel
(90-755/90-775) and advanced software that can handle larger problem instances (94-867).

Third, you should develop skill at writing mathematical equations that represent the
“physics” (operational reality) of systems that you will be responsible for managing and
improving. (All courses in the sequence)
Fourth, you should understand the inner workings of the algorithms that computers
use to solve these equations (“models”) well enough to know which types of problems are
“hard” or “easy” for the computer to solve, what that implies for the “size” problem that
can be handled, and some tricks for transforming “hard” into “easier” problems to solve.
(90-755 & 94-867)
Fifth, you should develop sophistication in your ability to interpret model solutions’
implications for practical managerial decision making. That will be done in 90-755/90775 via small cases, and in 94-867 via larger cases and a term project.

Sixth, you should develop skill at addressing complex, ill-defined, large-scale
decision-making problems that arise in policy and management. This will be done by
learning the theory and analytical toolsets for executing a “data-to-decisions” pipeline in a
principled way. In 94-867, students build on the management science methods learned
from 90-755 and 90-775, along with tools from other Heinz courses (e.g., predictive tools
from machine learning and statistics), to convert data to information (using regression,
neural networks, hybrid mechanistic and ML models) and to embed that information in
optimization models (via contextual optimization, decision-making under uncertainty and
risk, and iterative learning-and-optimization methods such as approximation dynamic
optimization and reinforcement learning). Students will work in Python and utilize a set of
advanced data-to-decision packages (Gurobi, GurobiML, sklearn) to solve large cases.
### Text:

Required: Cliff T. Ragsdale’s Spreadsheet Modeling and Decision Analysis: A Practical
## Introduction to Business Analytics, 9th edition, which you can order from Cengage. You

can get by with the 6th, 7th or 8th editions, although the text does evolve a little and problem
numbering changes, so be careful about that.
### Canvas:

Canvas will be used for distributing materials, posting videos, conducting discussions
(some graded), submitting homework and exams, etc. You should monitor it daily.
### Recitations:

Friday recitations are optional.
### Grading:

### Course grades are based on:

Best 4 out of 5 weekly homeworks: 4 X 6 = 24%
Two tests (April 11th and during final exam week): 30% & 40% = 70%
Attendance & class participation (everyone gets 2 “free” absences to cover all sorts of
exigencies): 6%
### Homework:

I drop one (the lowest) homework grade to allow for all manner of special circumstances
including illness, death in the family, job interviews, etc. You do not need to tell me about
those circumstances; one will be dropped regardless. I will not drop more than one except
under truly extraordinary circumstances; usually if someone misses two or more weeks it
is better to take an incomplete and finish the class next year.

Homework can be typed or hand-written, but must be neat. TA’s cannot give points for
things they cannot read. Late assignments will not be accepted. HW should be submitted
through Canvas’ Gradescope.

HW can be done individually or in groups of two to four (max). Groups should submit one
HW, and everyone in the group will receive the same grade. You do not need to work with
the same people all semester, and groups can have members from different sections.

There should be minimal interaction across groups concerning homework problems. You
may discuss the readings, concepts, and problems that are not assigned, but you should not
collaborate on the assigned homework problems in any way. Obtaining or providing a
copy of another group’s work, either their answers or a spreadsheet they used, is cheating
and will be subject to sanction up to failure in the course and reporting of the incident to
the Dean for possible expulsion from the College.

If there is a substantial error in grading of a homework, you may ask the TA’s for a regrade. Please do not worry about minor issues. Each individual homework problem counts
for a modest portion of the course grade, and TA time is scarce and valuable for things like
office hours.
### Tests:

File regrade requests via Gradescope (do not ask the TA’s) if there is any error in grading
of your exams. The basic principle is that if what you wrote was correct but was marked
wrong, we want to correct that. It should be obvious, but we cannot award points for wrong
answers even if you “knew how to do it” or it is really important to you to get a higher
grade. (Variations of those arguments were elements of many regrade requests in the past
and they will not be accepted.)
### Attendance & Class participation:

Just as I drop the lowest homework to allow for all manner of special circumstances, I only
expect you to attend 11 of the 13 classes, and I do not want or need to be told reasons for
absences. If something requires extended absence (e.g., getting COVID) we can discuss a
special accommodation. But if you just have 3 job interviews or 2 job interviews and 1
cold that keeps you home on three days, then please just accept that as attending on 10 of
the 13 days with associated (very minor) grade loss. I want to incentivize attendance and
reward those with good attendance, but do not want to distract you or me from teaching
and learning with negotiating and documenting things that are not exceptional or extended.

Note: This grade is based on attendance and participation. Attending and saying nothing
in all classes will not earn a full 6 out of 6 for class participation. Nor, at the other extreme,
will “cluttering” the class with unproductive comments be misconstrued for the sort of
thoughtful, active engagement that is expected of graduate students and professionals.
### Academic Integrity:

Cheating will be punished, typically by failure in and dismissal from the course as well as
reporting the infraction to the Dean for consideration of further sanctions.
### Taping or Recording Classroom Activities

One section’s classes will be recorded, with a link posted to Canvas, but you may not
record them privately unless you have a disability accommodation that permits it; some
people are personally or culturally uncomfortable with being recorded and we do not
want to suppress free participation.
