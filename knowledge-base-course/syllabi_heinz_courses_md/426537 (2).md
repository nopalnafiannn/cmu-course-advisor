### Course Prerequisites:

Students should have taken graduate courses that cover both information technology
(Core IT Design/Development/Management/Analytics, etc.) and business/managerial
topics (Financial management, business analytics, economic analysis, etc.). No firm prerequisites are required.
### Course Description:

This course serves as a capstone course integrating technological and managerial aspects of
information technology. We will take the culmination of your previous learning of
technological and managerial subjects and apply it to real-world scenarios. Each section will
consider the information and communication technologies that play multiple roles within an
organizational context through several perspectives:
 From a technological perspective, these define the information and communication
infrastructures of the firm and how they enable new ways to digitize business processes.
 From a managerial perspective, these facilitate the new coordination and
communications within and across entities, enabling new organizational forms, changing
the information environment underlying the business, and permitting new incentive
structures.
 From a policy perspective, these new coordination and communication processes, new
organizational forms, new modes of cross-organizational interaction, and new incentive
& monitor structures that frequently challenge established policy and regulatory
structures, which can also lead to the potential for regulation to undermine these new and
existing processes.
# 95-722 — Digital Transformation Syllabus, Fall 2024 Version: 4/11/2024

# 95-722 — Digital Transformation Syllabus Page 2 of 12

Successful efforts at digitization must keep both technological & managerial perspectives
in mind. Using a collection of cases and current industry scenarios, this course will study
how deployment of information technology changes interactions & processes within
organizations, across organizations, within industries, and across society.

The analyses of the different organizations and industries will require students to engage
in both technical and managerial problem-solving. The technical component of the
analysis requires students to propose IT architectures for the problems highlighted in the
case. The managerial component of the analysis requires students to analyze the business
value of the proposed solution and address the change management issues that arise in
implementing any digital transformation initiative.
### High-Level Learning Objectives and Outcomes:

 Analyze and interpret transformations of IT in the four areas of competitive advantage,
org structure, industry structure, and institutional policy.
 Analyze and interpret methods of productivity growth through modern interpretations of
digitized input and output drivers.
 Distinguish between and systematically assessing components of change through
sustaining and disruptive technologies with proper management of demand and supplyside drivers.
 Identify and examine key technological challenges and rewards from systems
innovations, first-mover advantages and disadvantages, and the potential disruptions or
opportunities to culture, cross-industry collaborations, design thinking, and trust.
### Reading Materials:

A “digital” reading packet containing most of the cases and readings for this course is
available from HBS Publishing. Details & a link to HBS case studies is listed on Canvas.

Supplemental readings are available on Canvas and/or will be distributed in class. There
is no textbook requirement.
### Attendance Policy:

Students are expected to attend & participate in scheduled mandatory classes. As most
classes involve team-based work including live presentations, it’s imperative students are
a part of each discussion. Any meeting not deemed mandatory are optional attendance.

### Cheating, Plagiarism, and Academic Integrity:

Students at CMU are engaged in preparation for professional activity of the highest
standards. Each profession constrains its members with both ethical responsibilities and
disciplinary limits. To assure the validity of the learning experience Carnegie Mellon
establishes clear standards for student work. You are required to be familiar with all
university policies on the subject (see
http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Cheating.html). An extract of these policies is
reproduced here:
In any presentation, creative, artistic, or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each
student to identify conceptual sources of work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest &
is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.
### Cheating includes but is not necessarily limited to:

o Plagiarism, explained below.
o Submission of work that is not the student's own: papers, assignments, exams, etc.
o Submission or use of falsified data.
o Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam or quiz.
o Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination.
o Use of unauthorized material including textbooks, notes or computer programs in
the preparation of an assignment or during an examination.
o Supplying or communicating in any way unauthorized information to another
student for the preparation of an assignment or during an examination.
o Collaboration in the preparation of an assignment. Unless specifically permitted
or required by the instructor, collaboration will usually be viewed by the
university as cheating. Each student, therefore, is responsible for understanding
the policies of the department offering any course as they refer to the amount of
help and collaboration permitted in preparation of assignments.
o Submission of the same work for credit in two courses without obtaining the
permission of the instructors beforehand.

Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, failure to indicate the source with
quotation marks or footnotes where appropriate if any of the following are
reproduced in the work submitted by a student:
o A phrase, written or musical.
o A graphic element.
o A proof.
o Specific language.
o An idea derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another person.

Regarding plagiarism, you should also familiarize yourself with the content of the
separate handout entitled “A Note on Plagiarism and Citing Sources.”
# 95-722 — Digital Transformation Syllabus, Fall 2024 Version: 4/11/2024

# 95-722 — Digital Transformation Syllabus Page 4 of 12

One application of this plagiarism policy for our class is that you may not provide or
receive information on case write-ups or class discussions from students outside of your
section. This includes both students from prior and current DT sections & semesters.

A Note Regarding Case “Solutions” on the Web
These cases are used at a variety of school. There may be slides & other materials available
for them on the web. I am asking you not to use these materials for the following reasons:
## 1. Presumably you are here to learn how to best design, implement, and manage corporate

IT systems. The best way to do that is to struggle with these issues yourself and with your
teammates and classmates. Anything less and you are wasting your time and money as a
student and short-changing your long-term growth as an IT professional. Making (and
learning from) mistakes today is a very low-cost way to improve your skills. Once you hit
the corporate world, the mistakes become very costly.
## 2. Case analysis is not like algebra where there is a particular answer that the grader is

looking for. These cases are typically written with multiple possible recommendations.

Don't assume that just because someone in some business school says you should do X,
that X is the “correct” way (or even a good way) to approach a particular case.
## 3. You run the risk that others in the class will come across the same materials, make the

same recommendation as you (possibly using very similar words) — which raises huge red
flags regarding plagiarism.
## 4. It damages our classroom discussion. If everyone gives the same recommendation, we

don't have the opportunity to fully explore other options — and exploring and learning
from other options is part of the joy and excitement of case work.
## 5. It makes you subservient to the recommendations of others — who may or may not

know anything about the underlying technology, IT project management, etc. One of the
premises of the MISM/MSIT program is that people with a strong IT background will be
able to do a better job managing IT projects than others who don't have a tech background.

I'm assuming that's why you are here and not somewhere else.

So, for the sake of your professional development, our classroom discussion, your
academic integrity, and your pride in your degree program, using someone else's case
“solutions” is a bad idea. However, if you insist on using these resources, you must cite
your sources in the body of your report and on your slides, whether you use direct quotes
from them or not. You are, of course, perfectly free (and encouraged) to research any of the
companies or issues that we discuss in class. I am just asking that you not use outside
discussions of the cases themselves.

Use of Generative AI (ChatGPT)
I expect you will use AI (e.g., ChatGPT and image generation tools) in this class. In fact,
# 95-722 — Digital Transformation Syllabus, Fall 2024 Version: 4/11/2024

# 95-722 — Digital Transformation Syllabus Page 5 of 12

some assignments require it. Learning to use AI is an emerging skill and to get started, I have
provided three tutorials below:
 How to use ChatGPT to boost your writing
 The practical guide to using AI to do stuff
 APA citation guidelines for GAI (ChatGPT example)
### You should also be aware of the limits of ChatGPT:

 If you provide minimum-effort prompts, you will get low-quality results. You will
need to refine your prompts in order to get good outcomes. This will take work.
 Don’t trust everything it says. If it gives you a number or fact, assume it’s wrong unless
you either know the answer or can check with another source. You will be responsible for
any errors or omissions provided by the tool. It works best for topics you understand.
 AI is a tool, but one that you need to acknowledge using. Please include a paragraph at
the end of any assignment that uses AI explaining what you used the AI for and what
prompts you used to get the results. Failure to do so can constitute as an academic
integrity violation.
 Be thoughtful about when this tool is useful. Don’t use it if it isn’t appropriate for the
case or circumstance.
### Resources we may use to validate work against generative AI (and that you can use) include:

https://aiwritingcheck.org/
https://www.turnitin.com/ (built into Canvas)
https://github.com/jwkirchenbauer/lm-watermarking
https://gptzero.me/
### Some CMU strategies being employed include:

https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/technology/aitools/index.html
### You may use generative AI for the following work:

 Group & individual assignments
### You may NOT use generative AI for the following work:

 Surveys & the final exam
I am happy to meet and help you with these tools during office hours or after class.

Course Web Site: http://canvas.cmu.edu
We will use Canvas for course information and announcements. If you are registered in
the class, you should already have access. Your login id is your andrew id & password.

If you’re on the wait list, you won’t be able to access the site. Contact us for content.

The web site has an up-to-date copy of the syllabus, schedule, pertinent documentation,
A/V, and any class announcements. While I will try to make announcements both in class
and on the web site, it is a good idea for you to check the web site regularly.

Additionally, the web site has links to class readings and relevant sites mentioned in class
and more extensive background material.
### Grading and Course Requirements:

You will be evaluated on the basis of your case analyses & presentations, class
participation, and an individual final assessment handed out at the end of the mini. Your
team-based presentations will be graded as group work with a peer evaluation tool. All
other grades are individual based. Canvas should only be used to track individual grades,
not cumulative. The grading system on Canvas does not accurately track the grading
scheme used in this class. Please follow up with the TA and/or myself for grading
questions. The breakdown for your work is as follows:
### Student Tasks: Total # of Tasks Earning Potential Overall %

### Profile & Surveys 5 60 6%

Class (synchronous) and Canvas (asynchronous) Discussion Participation: The quality of
our learning environment is contingent on effective and informed participation of each
class member. The goal here is not to dazzle us with your individual brilliance or with the
number of comments you make, but rather to help make the class smarter. Note that, in
addition to providing new insights to the discussion, it is possible to make the class smarter
by asking the right question or by assimilating comments from other students or sources.

The Canvas analyses are designed to help you participate in an effective manner outside of
class. The quality of your comments and your ability to build on and respond to threads in
a conversation about all issues will be considered in assigning your participation grade.

It is important to note that canvas contribution is assessed on an individual basis.

### Grading Rubric (25% per criteria below):

a. Preparation, original thought/contribution (reflects a perspective building from
discussions in class), contributed to original scenario/question.
b. Ability to coherently present arguments and to contribute to a discussion (vs. creating
new threads), development of thought (Full explanation, details, insights).
c. Ability to influence and persuade others in class to agree with your opinion, or to provide
a thoughtful critique to another thought (beyond general agreements) with elaboration.
d. Is error free, contains references, and meets or exceeds required length.

Class Contribution: is inherently a subjective assessment but will take the following
factors into account: 1. Showing up to all classes for the week, paying attention with
distractions removed (phone, computer, Tamagotchi, etc.) 2. Contributing to the learning
in the classes via synch and asych mechanisms.

Case Analysis: You case analysis grade is based on a 2-page write-up (1 to 1.5-spacing,
12-point Time New Roman font, 1-inch margins) + up to 3 exhibit pages. You case
submission is due to Canvas by midnight the day before the case is discussed in class.

I will also assign groups to present their recommendations to class. Your write-up and
presentation should address issues raised in the case narrative & associated discussion
questions. You are encouraged to go beyond the set of questions that I give you to seed the
discussion and to use additional resources to research the background of the firms as you see
fit. Case analysis documents are group work and should adopt the following perspective:
a. What are the business/strategic drivers of process digitization in the particular
environment being analyzed?
b. What is the role of IT architecture in either enabling or inhibiting process digitization?
c. Given your knowledge of technologies to date, do you agree with the choice of
technologies and the manner in which the technologies were deployed in process
digitization?
d. Did the case describe the organizational challenges encountered in process digitization?

Do you agree with the manner in which the organizational challenges were dealt with? If
the case did not describe organizational challenges, what do anticipate them to be and
what are your recommendations for overcoming them?

The format for the case write-up is contained in a handout that will be provided in class. For
presentations, you should target 20 minutes of prepared comments, but with enough backup
slides/information to answer any questions that might arise about your recommendations.

Final Assessment: There will be a take home final assessment assigned during finals week
and due by the end of that week. The assessment will ask you to integrate information we
have learned across the lectures, cases and readings we’ve covered during the semester.

Peer Review: Since the case analyses are group work, I will use a peer review instrument
to ensure that feedback from group members about team member contributions are
considered in the determination of the final grade. 50% of the peer evaluation is dependent
on your timely and well-documented submission, with the other 50% dependent on the
scoring from your peers.
### A Note on Regrade Requests:

We make every effort to return graded assignments within 1 week of their submission. If you
believe that your grade is inaccurate, you may request a regrade under the following
conditions:
## 1. Regrade requests must be submitted within 1 week of the grade posting date.

# 95-722 — Digital Transformation Syllabus, Fall 2024 Version: 4/11/2024

# 95-722 — Digital Transformation Syllabus Page 11 of 12

## 2. Regrade requests must be in writing and must include a copy of the original assignment.

## 3. Regrade requests must outline the reasons you deserve a higher grade. These will

typically be that the grader misread or misunderstood your answer, or didn’t take
something into account that they should have. For this, you should use the written
comments on the assignment as your reference point. Referencing another student’s grade
is inappropriate and irrelevant. While we do our best to apply an even standard across
students, we can’t discuss anyone else’s grade with you, so we need to deal with the
merits of your particular case.
## 4. I reserve the right to regrade the entire assignment and thus your grade may go up, down,

or stay the same. This regrade is considered final.
## 5. Class participation grades are inherently subjective and are not subject to a regrade

request. I will make notes on participation at the end of each class and assign grades at
the end of the semester based on these notes.
## 6. At the conclusion of class (at the end of the last assignment), no regrade requests, retakes,

redo’s, or extra credit assignments that can be done. Please be sure to contact the TA
and/or the instructor during the semester for grade concerns and ways to improve.
### Late Submission Policy:

All late assignments are subject to a grade penalty of 10% per day past the due date/time,
with a maximum of 4 days. Anything submitted beyond 4 days past the due date receives an
automatic 0. Teams and individual submissions are subject to the same policy. Any issue
with meeting a deadline must be cleared through the instructor and/or TA prior to the
submission date/time or will be subject to the penalty.
### Student Health and Wellness:

CMU and all classes, including this one, strive to accommodate students in all capacities by
creating a learning environment that considers the health and well-being of all students. A
review the university policies regarding health and wellness can be reviewed at:
https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/current-grad-students/health-and-wellness/index.html
Review graduate student policies at: https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/index.html
Support hotline for students. Lean On Me is an online community support hotline where
CMU students can text in and talk anonymously to trained supporters, who are also CMU
students: (412) 530-4700 or send a message on Instagram @leanonme.cmu!

Covid-19 Policies
Facial Coverings: Facial coverings both indoors and outdoors are optional.

Vaccinations: All students, faculty & staff are no longer required to be up to date
on vaccinations.
# 95-722 — Digital Transformation Syllabus, Fall 2024 Version: 4/11/2024

# 95-722 — Digital Transformation Syllabus Page 12 of 12

As of May 12 2023, CMU has decommissioned Tartan Testing operations and the
lab. Testing is no longer required. COVID-19 tests will be available in the vending
machine located in the Cohon University Center until supplies are depleted.

CMU no longer requires reporting COVID-19 cases. Community members who
contract COVID-19 should follow the guidance of their care provider regarding isolation,
as they would with any communicable disease.

Diversity and Inclusion
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds & perspectives be well served
by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in & out of class, & that
diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength & benefit. It is
my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race & culture. Your
suggestions are encouraged & appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the
effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In
addition, if any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me
know so we can make arrangements for you.

The topics that we’re covering in this class can be difficult, not just intellectually but
emotionally. While I expect there to be rigorous discussion and even disagreement during
our class discussions, I ask that you engage in discussion with care and empathy for the
other members in the classroom. Aim to disagree without becoming disagreeable. In this
class we will not shy away from the uncomfortable. Critically examining and assessing
our most basic assumptions and values is not just one of the tasks of philosophy but is an
activity vital to living an authentic life. I urge you to have the courage to the
uncomfortable in this class. In exchange for your courage, I will work to ensure a
classroom environment that supports your taking these intellectual and emotional risks.
