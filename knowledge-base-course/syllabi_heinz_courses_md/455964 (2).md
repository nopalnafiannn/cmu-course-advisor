Course Description
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries by driving innovation, improving efficiency, and enhancing
decision-making processes. Yet, despite its potential, many AI projects face significant hurdles in deployment.

According to a recent survey, only 22% of data scientists report that their "revolutionary" AI initiatives—those
designed to enable new processes or capabilities—usually reach deployment. Alarmingly, 43% say that 80% or
more of their AI projects fail to make it into production. Even when considering all types of machine learning
projects, including those focused on refreshing existing models, only 32% of models typically deploy. These
statistics underscore the critical challenges of scaling AI systems effectively.

This course is designed to tackle these challenges head-on, providing graduate-level students with a
comprehensive understanding of the AI lifecycle. Students will learn how to navigate the complex process of
identifying which business tasks should be automated through AI and which decisions should be augmented using
AI. The course introduces practical frameworks essential for making these strategic decisions and successfully
implementing AI solutions.

Throughout the course, students will engage deeply with each stage of the AI lifecycle. They will learn to identify and
prioritize high-impact AI use cases, conduct thorough cost-benefit analyses, and design strategic roadmaps aimed
at maximizing return on investment (ROI). The curriculum blends theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience
using industry-standard tools such as Jupyter Lab, Docker, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Kafka, and Evidently. These
tools are critical for overcoming the common pitfalls associated with AI deployment and preparing students to scale
AI systems in real-world environments.

The course’s practical orientation is further enhanced through case studies that serve as a foundation for class
discussions. These case studies provide students with the opportunity to analyze real-world AI applications, assess
the challenges involved, and understand the decision-making processes behind successful implementations.

Additionally, two guest lectures from seasoned industry practitioners will offer firsthand insights into the practical
challenges of AI deployment across various sectors.

A strong emphasis is placed on governance and trust, equipping students with the knowledge to develop ethical,
transparent, and effective AI systems. Students will learn how to integrate AI into organizational processes, assess
talent and skill gaps, and create strategies to build the necessary capabilities for sustained AI-driven innovation.

This course is essential for students aspiring to careers as AI engineers, AI analysts, or AI governance experts. It is
equally invaluable for business and technology students who wish to understand how to manage the development
and deployment of AI systems. By the end of the course, students will possess a well-rounded, practical
understanding of AI system management, enabling them to lead AI-driven projects and drive innovation across
industries.
