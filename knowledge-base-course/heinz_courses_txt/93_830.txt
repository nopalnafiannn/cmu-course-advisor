# 93-830: Technologies Transforming the Arts

## Course Information

**Units:** 6

## Description

‬ ‭ The world is undergoing monumental change. These transformations are fueled by the aftermath of the‬ ‭ entry of the personal computer to the mass marketplace and the introduction of the World Wide Web in‬ ‭ the mid-1990s. These actions opened up opportunities for computing and creativity using modern‬ ‭ technology akin to the Industrial Revolution. Richard Florida identified and coined the term‬‭ creative‬ ‭ economy‬‭ . Some have also coined this time as the second‬‭ Renaissance, noting that this era is changing‬ ‭ our core frameworks for civilization. As in the age of the Renaissance, creativity and the arts are often at‬ ‭ the cutting edge for creating and incorporating technologies in the world, even though some nonprofit‬ ‭ institutions seem slow to adapt.‬ ‭ This seminar-style course provides students with multiple perspectives on how emerging technologies‬ ‭ are transforming arts enterprises:‬‭ arts-making‬‭ ,‬‭ audience‬‭ engagement‬‭ , and‬‭ administration (also called‬ ‭ producers, intermediaries, and consumers)‬‭ . From Artificial‬‭ Intelligence to the Internet of Things to‬ ‭ Virtual Reality, students will investigate what is happening in the field and what’s on the fringe and about‬ ‭ to break into the marketplace. Through class materials, hands-on activities, and individualized‬ ‭ curiosity-fueled research, the course provides a breadth of understanding of multiple technologies.‬ ‭ Additionally, each student leaves the class with a deeper understanding of one transformational‬ ‭ technology and a hands-on experience with two technologies of their choice.‬ ‭
