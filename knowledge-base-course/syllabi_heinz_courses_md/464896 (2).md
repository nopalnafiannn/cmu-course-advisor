Lectures
Labs for each section are held on Wednesday during these same times. You will
be assigned a subsection (1, 2, etc.) within your lab time. See below for details.

Lectures will not be recorded. Per University guidelines, "Students are

### *  You have 7 grace days you can use to turn in projects late with no

penalty. Grace days may *only* be used for projects.
### *  This policy is meant to cover such issues as minor illness, job

interviews, travel, and so on.
*  Any portion of a day late (e.g. 1 second) counts as one grace day used.

Project Assignments
### *  TAs will keep track of your late days, and after 7, a penalty of 10% per

and Late
day late will be applied.

Assignments
### *  You should not contact the instructors nor TAs when you use your one

late allowance; it will be automatically applied.
*  A second late is late. Plan ahead so that you are not trying to submit
with 10 seconds to go, and find that the Canvas server clock is 11
seconds ahead of your laptop clock.

Labs *  Each student must be registered for and regularly attend a lab.

### *  Labs are primarily hands-on activities, where assistance from fellow

students and a TA is available.
### *  You are allowed to help other students and get help from other students

on labs (and labs only).
### *  For attending your registered lab and making it to the defined

checkpoint before the end of the lab session you receive 0.25%.
### *  Lab attendance and checkpoint may be verified only by the TA running

your assigned lab session.
### *  When completing the lab before the due date (typically the following

Monday a 2:00pm) you receive 0.75%.
### *  Completed lab work may be shown to any DS TA during his or her o0ice

hours.
### *  There will be questions on the exams that test for having completed and

understood the labs.
*  Late labs receive zero credit. There are no exceptions to this policy. The
lowest lab grade is automatically dropped from the final grade.

For each lecture, there will be pre-class material to read or watch and a preclass quiz. This short quiz will be available only from 2:00pm Friday until
Weekly Quizzes 2:00pm Monday Pittsburgh time. No credit will be given for the quiz outside this
timeframe. There will be 12 quizzes, and the two lowest-scored quizzes will be
dropped and 10 will be counted in your final grade.

Collaboration is permitted in Labs but not on any other assignments. Copying
code without citing it is cheating. Copying code from a fellow student is
cheating.

You may choose to use a large language model to assist with your programming
work, unless it is otherwise prohibited – please read the directions carefully.

Note that LLMs often make mistakes. You are responsible for any errors or
problems that may be present in the code that you submit. The closed book
exams are designed to test your knowledge and coding skills. So, if you do use a
large language model, be sure to master the material and truly understand the
code before taking an exam.

Policy on
collaboration and However, your responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow
cheating the academic integrity guidelines of the university and of this class. If you
use one of these generative AI tools to develop content for an assignment, you
are required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work, just as you should cite
code acquired from any other source.

If you copy code from the Web, be sure to provide a comment in the code with
the exact URL where the code was copied from. In practice, cutting and pasting
content from any source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing
content from a generative AI without citation is plagiarism. Similarly, using any
generative AI tool without appropriate acknowledgement will be treated as
plagiarism. The university’s policy on plagiarism applies to all uncited or
improperly cited use of work, whether that work is created by human beings

alone or in collaboration with a generative AI. Provide as a comment in the code
the exact URL where the code was copied from.

Code that is provided by the instructors is allowed as long as the code is clearly
cited as being provided by the instructors. Of course, if you have violated the
spirit of the project, you will earn zero points.

In addition to any penalties imposed by the instructor, all cheating and
plagiarism infractions will be reported in writing to the Associate Dean for the
program, the Associate Dean of Faculty, the Dean of Student A0airs, and the
Dean. They will review and determine if expulsion should be recommended.

The report will become part of the student’s record.

The appropriate people to refer to for help in homework projects are the TAs
and the instructors. They can look at your code and help you with it. See them
during o0ice hours.
### Given that:

### *  There are very many students in 95-702, so dealing with lots of

individual email doesn't scale.
### *  Other students often have the same questions you do

### *  There are TA and instructor o0ice hours

### Regarding Class Absences:

*  Don't send us email, we don't need to know.
*  You are responsible for the content.
*  Come to o0ice hours if you have questions.
### Regarding Questions about Class Topics:

*  Ask in class. !!!
*  Use Piazza to post your question.
*  Come to o0ice hours if you have followup questions.
### Regarding Homework Project Questions:

*  Ask in class. !!!
### *  Use Piazza to post questions

Communication
*  Go to TA o0ice hours.

Guidelines
*  Go to faculty o0ice hours if the TAs have not been able to help.
### Regarding Late Homework Project Submission:

### *  Read the policy on late submissions

o With so many students, they cannot change.
*  Do not email instructors nor TAs that your project will be late.
### *  If your assignment is late (even one minute late) the TAs will apply the

late allowance. Future late assignments will lose 10% per any part of a
day.
*  Plan ahead.
### Regarding What is On the Final Exam:

### *  Assume anything discussed in class or in lab or assigned as readings

might be on the final exam.
*  Ask specific questions about this material in class.
### *  Come to faculty o0ice hours if you have specific questions

*  Don't ask "What is on the final exam?"
*  Don't ask "Will X be on the final exam?"

### Regarding Grading Complaints:

### *  See "Policy on complaints about grading" below

If you have a serious personal problem that impacts your ability to proceed
normally thorough the course, please don't hesitate to email or see the
instructors. Those we certainly do want to hear about and are happy to help
you with!

We hope and intend that the TAs will provide you with valuable assistance.
### *  TAs should:

o Be present for lab sessions and o0ice hours.
o Mark when you have achieved the lab checkpoint, and the
complete lab.
o Be helping students during labs and o0ice hours, not doing their
own work.
o Help you understand the project assignments and class topics
o Help you with general questions concerning your project
assignment code.
o Help you go over what your code should or should not be doing.
o Grade your projects within two weeks of submission
### Role of TAs *  TAs should not:

o Find your code bugs.
o Fix your code for you.
o Show you their version of the code.
### *  TAs are also very busy students, and cannot reply to your questions by

email, chat, phone, Facebook, Twitter, SMS, smoke signal, or telepathy.
o Except if they invite you to contact them.
o Don't abuse the o0er.
### *  If you have complements or problems with the TAs assistance:

o The instructors definitely want to know about it.
o Please tell us about it before or after class, or during o0ice
hours.
o Please do not send it in email, unless instructed by us.
*  Exams take precedence over job interviews and trips.

Conflicts with the
### *  No allowances or rescheduling will be given for missing the final exam

because of a job interview, job trip, marriage, or good air fares.
*  TAs need to make distinctions between excellent, good, and bad work.
*  Grading mistakes may occur.
### *  Please contact the TA who graded your assignment about grading

mistakes.
*  It will be up to the TA to handle the complaint.

Policy on *  If you are still not satisfied with the TA's grade please contact your
complaints about instructor.
grading *  Our initial reaction will be to support the TA's grade.
### *  In some cases, however, we might agree with the student and ask for

the grade to be adjusted.
### *  Please make any grading concerns known to the TA immediately (within

1 week).
*  Set up an appointment with the TA and get the matter resolved.

*  A TA will normally be assigned to grade the projects.
### *  Given the number of students in the course, we will sometimes use the

Project Grading common practice of selecting some sections of a code or project
reflections and grading that carefully and assigning the assignment
grade based on that segment(s).

We must treat every individual with respect.

We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and
maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer
to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race,
color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender
identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information.

Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here,
shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and sta0 bring to our campus.

We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only
because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to
A Diverse, Equitable, pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit
and Inclusive to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a
Course Community campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional
or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for
individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages
anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of
identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident
or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the
following resources:

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be
any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all
shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and
just.

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well,
exercising, avoiding recreational drugs and excessive alcohol, getting enough
sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and
cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There
are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the
college experience is learning how to ask for help. Ask for support sooner rather
than waiting.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, di0icult life
events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek
