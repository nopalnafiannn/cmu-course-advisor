# ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are taken extremely seriously.

Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most
serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required
paper or assignment or as cheating on an examination, regardless of whether it is a take-home
or in-class examination. The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the
program. There are many other ways in which a violation can occur.

Academic Dishonesty: Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards inside
and outside the classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e., plagiarism and
unauthorized collaboration) is obviously discouraged and will be treated appropriately. The
usual penalty for violations is a failing grade for the particular assignment in question; however,
in some instances, such actions may result in a failing grade for the course. All violations will be
reported to the Associate Dean in accordance with Heinz College and University policies.
# DEADLINES AND ACCOMMODATIONS

All assignments are due by the dates shown in this syllabus unless modified in class by the
instructor. If it is anticipated that an assignment may be turned in late due to an extenuating
circumstance, such as illness, contact the instructor immediately. If special accommodations are
required, please refer to the University’s policy on accommodations and statement on student
wellness and notify the instructor of any needs.
### ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES:

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office,
discuss your accommodations and needs with the instructor as early in the semester as
possible. The instructor will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as
appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from
accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, you are
encouraged to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.
# USE OF TECHNOLOGY

This semester involves regular use of technology during class – both for in-person and remote
students. Research has shown that divided attention is detrimental to learning, so you are
encouraged to close any windows not directly related to what we are doing while you are in
class. Please turn off your phone notifications and limit other likely sources of technology
disruption, so you can fully engage with the material, each other, and the instructor. This will
create a better learning environment for everyone. Since the class sessions will be delivered
synchronously in-person and remotely, a laptop will be required for our in-person classes to
enable collaboration with classmates who are remote.
