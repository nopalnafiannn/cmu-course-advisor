*** Interim Syllabus***
This syllabus is an interim syllabus, as of March 9, 2025. It is provided to aid students in making course
selections during the Mini 4 add drop window. Students are welcome to e-mail with any questions on the class.

This syllabus may be further updated or revised, and students are encouraged to check Canvas for the most

Course Description
● Introduction to Intellectual Property for Arts Managers will introduce important concepts of trademark and
copyright law. A significant portion of the the class will focus on copyright, with the goal of developing an
understanding of the scope of rights, exceptions, and fair use. Considerations related to traditional cultural
expressions will also be explored. While the class will introduce doctrine, emphasis will be placed on
common issues and scenarios encountered by arts organizations. Students will also learn about creative
commons licenses, considerations regarding social media, and the evolving discourse on artificial
intelligence.

Learning Objectives
### By the end of this class you should:

● Understand key doctrines of copyright and trademark law.
● Be familiar with resources available from governments, NGOs, and industry associations.
● Learn how intellectual property issues may present in arts institutions, and how different institutions
approach these issues.
● Gain an understanding of copyright limitations and exceptions, including fair use.
● Practice using plain language to convey complex information.

Course Materials
● Textbook: Young, Anne M., Rights and Reproduction: The Handbook for Cultural Institutions (Second
Edition), Rowman & Littlefield 2018.
● Canvas Readings: Additional materials and readings will be posted in Canvas under the Assignments tab.

Expectations
● Engagement: This course meets for two sessions, five hours each session. Students are expected to
participate in class discussions and activities. Attendance is required to demonstrate engagement.
● Canvas: This course will use Canvas extensively for posting reading assignments, the submission of
reflections, and other in class materials. Announcements will be posted via Canvas, and materials may be
updated as the course progresses.

Grading Policies
● Late-work: Due dates for every assignment are provided on the course syllabus and posted in Canvas.

Unless otherwise stated, assignments are due on those days. As this class is a micro-mini maintaining the
schedule is important. However, I recognize that sometimes “life happens.” In these instances, a one time 36
hour extension may be granted provided it is requested and confirmed by the instructor at least 2 hours
before the time due.
● Attendance and participation policy: Attendance and participation are expected in every class. Rubrics for
attendance and participation grading will be available on Canvas.

Course Policies
● Academic Integrity & Collaboration: This class encourages discussion and collaboration, but any final
work you submit should be your own, or in the case of group assignments, the work of the members of the
group. Sources should be cited.
● Recording: This class will not be recorded. No student may record any classroom activity without express
written consent from me. If you have (or think you may have) a disability such that you need to record or
tape classroom activities, you should contact the Office of Disability Resources to request an appropriate
accommodation.
● Mobile Devices: Mobile devises may be used occasionally for in class activities (e.g. Kahoot!s or similar).

During class sessions mobile devises must be set to silent. Incidental checking of phones or messages is
permitted but try to be discreet so as to not disturb your fellow students. Excessive mobile phone usage in
class will count against participation grades.
● Food/Drink: Food and water/soft drinks are allowed in the classroom provided they do not disturb others.

Please dispose of any trash during session breaks.
● Accommodations for students with disabilities: If you have a disability and have an accommodations
letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with
me as early in the mini as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as
appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are
not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at
access@andrew.cmu.edu.
● Student wellness: As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning,
such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/
or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic
performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and
treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus
at: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological
Services: 412-268-2922.
● Generative AI: To best support your own learning, you should complete all graded assignments in this
course yourself, without any use of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Please refrain from using AI tools to
generate any content (text, video, audio, images, code, etc.) for an assignment or classroom exercise.

Passing off any AI generated content as your own (e.g., cutting and pasting content into written
assignments, or paraphrasing AI content) constitutes a violation of CMU’s academic integrity policy. If you
have any questions about using generative AI in this course please email or talk to me.

Course Schedule
This course meets for two in person sessions. Student groups shall schedule a team meeting (virtual or in person)
