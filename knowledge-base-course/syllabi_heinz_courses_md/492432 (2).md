# 95-706 Z3 -- Syllabus

2025, Spring Z3
### Instructor: Constantine Aaron Cois, PhD

### Description:

Large-scale software development has been described as one of the most difficult of human
undertakings. This course examines the reasons for the inherent complexity of software
construction, and presents structured methods to deal effectively with it. The course will focus
on the object-oriented approach for analysis and design. Students will gain an appreciation of
the difference between writing programs and doing analysis and design. Problem formulation
and decomposition (analysis) and solution building (design) will be covered. Students will work
in small groups, each group having the responsibility for analysis, design and implementation
of a software system. Case tools will be used in several stages of the development process.
### Learning Objectives:

### *  Develop a working understanding of formal object-oriented analysis and design

processes.
*  Identify and describe the primary risks inherent to large-scale software development.
*  Apply techniques and processes designed to mitigate these risks. Construct OOAD
artifacts designed to enable these processes.
### *  Develop the skills to determine which processes and OOAD techniques should be applied

to a given project.
### *  Prepare students for industry by developing an understanding of the application of OOAD

practices from both software project management and software development perspectives.
### Prerequisites:

Knowledge of an Object-Oriented language such as Java, Python, or C++ is required for this
course.
### Office Hours:

Office hours will be held weekly via Zoom meetings, on the date and time listed on the course calendar. The

### Textbooks:

### Required Textbooks:

### Applying UML and Patterns, 3rd Edition, by Craig Larman

### Strongly Recommended Textbooks:

Software Requirements Author: Karl Wiegers | Publication Date: August 25, 2013 |
ISBN-13: 978-0-7356-7966-5 | Edition: 3rd ed.

Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Gamma,
### Helm, Johnson and Vlissides

### Grading:

Grading is project-based. There will be 5 projects assigned, 3 of which will be team projects.

Participating in projects and project teams is mandatory, and projects all build on the same
case study as the term progresses. Missing time, even early in the term, will be severely
detrimental to overall project performance, and thus course grade. If a student is unable to
avoid joining the class late in the semester and has missed assignment(s), the weight of these
assignments on their final grade will be evenly distributed over all other assignments.
### Assignment Submission:

Assignments are due in digital form at the date/time shown on Canvas. Late submissions will
receive a 10% grade reduction per day late.
### Policy on grading disputes:

When questions arise in grading of a project, the following steps must be taken to address the
issue:
## 1. If the student(s) disagree with a deduction, they will first contact the grader and ask for

an explanation of the grade.
## 2. If the student(s) still disagree, they will write a clear, detailed email to the professor

explaining why they feel points should not have been deducted.
## 3. The professor will make a final decision on whether points will be returned.

This procedure is mandatory to address grading issues.
### Lectures:

### In this distance section, we will refer to recorded lectures found here:

https://heinzcollege.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Channel/mediasiteadmin-95-706ooad-copyright-2016-carnegie-mellon-university/watch/
c210655d0a114db4a509c514f02cf48e1d
These recordings are from a section I taught on campus, and all material is valid for this
distance course.

Lecture material is supplemental to material covered in assigned readings, both textbook and
case study. You are responsible for all information covered in lecture and supplemental videos,
as well as information presented in posted slides and course readings.
### Grading Scale:

### The course grading scale is absolute (no curve). Grades are:

97.5-100 A+
92.5-97.4 A
90.0-92.4 A87.5-89.9 B+
82.5-87.4 B
80.0-82.4 B77.5-79.9 C+
72.5-77.4 C
70.0-72.4 C-
…and so on…
