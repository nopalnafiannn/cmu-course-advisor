Course Introduction: For most of the past 40 years, no region of the world has been
more economically dynamic than Asia. This economic growth transformed the patterns
of world trade, lifted millions out of absolute poverty, and so captivated the attention of
Western economists and business leaders that it was commonplace by the early 1990s to
refer to the economic achievements of these countries as the “East Asian miracle.”
The nature of this apparent miracle changed dramatically over the course of the 1990s as
the most advanced economy in the region, Japan, suffered a sharp growth slowdown, and
a number of the other "miracle" economies were engulfed in a regional economic crisis in
the latter half of the decade. These events highlighted weaknesses in the East Asian
growth model that had been hidden during the boom years.

Despite these economic problems, accelerating growth in the world's most populous
countries, China and India, helped sustain regional progress and kept global attention
focused on economic growth in Asia through the 2000s and 2010s, even though the
growth and the international attention were largely concentrated in a different set of
countries. However, new worries about economic growth have emerged in the aftermath
of the global COVID-19 pandemic, despite the relative success some Asian countries
enjoyed in terms of containing it. Is China's growth miracle slowing down? Can high
rates of growth be maintained in India? How does the economic history of Asia's more
advanced economies inform our view of the future economic prospects for India and
China? In what ways are China and India pursuing a different path to economic
development than that taken by their predecessors? The United States has long played an
important role in Asia as an investor, customer, and key ally of important nations in the
region. How will the policies of the Biden Administration shape these important
relationships and the future evolution of the region? We will seek to address all of these
questions.

Course Objectives: This course is designed to provide future business leaders and
policymakers with the essential knowledge necessary to evaluate economic opportunities
and risks in Asia. The course will use analytical tools drawn from several fields of
economics and finance as well as guest lectures by outside experts to focus on the key
strengths that sustained economic growth in Asia for decades, the weaknesses that
undermined that growth in more recent years, and what lies ahead. Considerable
attention will be paid to recent developments in India and China and the prospects for
continued growth in these economies over the next decade. The course will also focus on
the sharp changes in American economic and foreign policy with respect to Asia and the
likely impact of these policies on the region and on U.S.-Asia relations.

Students should acquire from this course an understanding of the roots of Asian
economic success, the current economic situation in the region, recent changes in U.S.
policy and their likely impact, and scenarios for the short to medium run future. More
importantly, students will acquire a set of conceptual and analytical tools that they can
use to understand the impact and significance of future developments in the region.

Outcome Measurement: A take-home midterm examination and a regular on-campus
final examination will be used to measure student mastery of the key analytical
frameworks and concepts that form the intellectual core of the course. Homework
exercises, online problems and quizzes, and classroom discussion will offer students the
opportunity to practice these tools and hone their understanding of key concepts prior to
the examinations.

Course Structure: The content of the course can be conceptually divided into six
sections. In terms of our progress through the course, these sections will sometimes
overlap with one another.
## Part 1 – Conceptual foundations

Throughout the course, we will be using the theory of economic growth as our conceptual
foundation for understanding the dynamic growth of Asia’s successful economies. We
will therefore begin with an in-depth review of both basic growth theory and some of the
key empirical regularities that have characterized both successful and unsuccessful
developing economies in the postwar era. Because Asia’s successful economies have
embraced trade and investment relationships with the rest of the world, we will also
ground ourselves in some international economic models to guide our thinking about
trade and industrial policy.
## Part 2 – Japan

In the 1960s and early 1970s, the Japanese economy grew more quickly than had any
other industrial economy in human history. By the 1980s, Japanese firms were
displacing their American and European competitors in global markets and many
respected observers expected Japan to overtake the United States as the world’s leading
economy. Yet, in the 1990s, the Japanese economy performed more poorly than almost
any of the “experts” predicted. While this performance improved somewhat in the 2000s,
Japan today is far from the economic powerhouse many expected it to be at this point in
the history of the region. What went wrong? What are the lessons for the rest of the
region from Japan's stunning rise to economic prominence? What are the lessons from its
surprising slowdown in the 1990s and 2000s? Our discussion of Japan will be enriched
by a virtual guest lecture from Professor Takatoshi Ito of Columbia University, a former
Vice Minister of Finance in the Government of Japan.
## Part 3 – South Korea, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and Australia

Even after the Japanese economy began to falter in the early 1990s, commentators
continued to believe that the world’s economic center of gravity was shifting to Asia, in
part due to the continued rapid economic growth of East Asia’s Newly Industrializing
Economies (NIEs), such as South Korea and Taiwan, and several nations in Southeast
Asia. This portion of the course examines the economic foundations of rapid growth in
South Korea, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia, and compares them to those that supported
rapid growth in Japan. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 was a major turning point
for these economies, and the poor performance of many of them during and after the
crisis led to a reevaluation of their strengths and weaknesses. We will review this event
and its continuing salience for the region. Finally, we will review the economic history
of Australia and find that this history, while quite different from that of Australia’s
Southeast Asian and East Asian trading and investment partners, strongly reinforces some
of the main lessons of the course.
## Part 4 – The People’s Republic of China

Even after the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, the People’s Republic of China
continued to grow at rapid rates. China is now the world's second largest economy
measured at market exchange rates, and some forecasters expect it to overtake the United
States in absolute economic size over the next 10 years. How has China managed its
unprecedented transition from communism to a more market-based economy? What role
have foreign firms played in this transformation? Is China susceptible to an economic
crisis or a prolonged slowdown? Is China destined to dominate Asia, economically and
militarily? We will explore all of these questions, drawing upon recent economic
research and outside experts. Our discussions will be enriched by a virtual guest lecture
from Professor Minxin Pei of Claremont McKenna College, a globally recognized expert
on Chinese political economy.
## Part 5 – The U.S., Asia, and a New Cold War?

For decades, the U.S. played a key role in the evolution of the Asian economic success
story as an important trading partner, investor, and military ally. The Trump
Administration took an approach to the region that differed sharply from that of earlier
administrations, Republican and Democratic. The Biden Administration appears to be
adopting something closer to a traditional approach, but it is retaining some Trump
Administration initiatives, particularly with respect to China. What impact will the Biden
Administration’s policies have? Would a different approach be more successful?
## Part 6 – India Emerges

From independence through the early 1980s, the Indian economy grew slowly and Indian
living standards lagged. Since then, economic reforms have led to a dramatic
acceleration of the rate of economic growth in India. Can this higher rate of growth be
sustained? How has the Indian road to development differed from that followed by the
East Asian nations? What are the challenges and opportunities in the U.S.-India
economic relationship? Our understanding of India’s prospects will be enhanced by a
virtual guest lecture from Arvind Panagariya, a globally recognized expert on the Indian
economy who recently served as a cabinet-level adviser to Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi.

Requirements and Grading
Class participation: This is an in-person expectation class. Class discussions are an
integral part of the course, and students are expected to attend class in person, interact
with our guest speakers, ask questions of the instructor, make comments, and participate
in these class discussions. To obtain full credit for class participation, the student must
engage in these class discussions in a manner that demonstrates thoughtful consideration
of the required readings. In other words, students actually have to talk to get full credit.

Class participation will account for 15% of the final grade. Classroom participation will
be actively monitored by the instructor and the TA. Please keep a mask on at all times
during class.
“Flipped Classroom” Online Quizzes and Problems: We have turned some of the
“lecture” material into pre-recorded videos, accessible on the class Canvas page, that
allow students to study the material outside of our normal class time. Implementing this
change allows us to spend more of our class time in discussion and other modes of active
learning. In order to make sure students are absorbing this online material, students will
be asked to complete some online problems and quizzes. Students are allowed to
collaborate when completing these problems and quizzes. These problems and quizzes
will be graded, and your average performance on these graded online problems/quizzes
will account for 15% of the final grade. In the detailed, day-by-day course plan that
follows, “course content module” refers to online video content and quizzes placed on the
website that students will be expected to review prior to the designated class meeting.

Midterm examination: A take-home midterm exam will be distributed in mid-October.

This exam will test the student’s mastery of the analytical tools developed in the first part
of the course. It will account for 25% of the total grade. Because undergraduates and
graduate students are both taking this course, there will be an undergraduate version of
the midterm and a graduate version of the midterm. Graduate students will be required to
answer an additional question. This will be an “open book, open note” exam, but
students are not allowed to collaborate with one other, to communicate with others
outside the class during the exam, or to use any internet resource other than the class
website.

Occasional short homework assignments: There will be a few homework assignments
distributed electronically over the course of the semester. You will be required to submit
solutions one week later, and the solutions will be graded. Your average score on the
homework assignments will account for 15% of the total grade. We will drop the lowest
score. You are allowed to work together with others in the class in order to complete the
homework assignments. Late submissions of homework assignments will be assessed a
penalty of 20% per day.

Final examination: There will be a final examination given on campus during the
regular exam period. The date and location will be determined later in the semester. This
will count for 30% of the total grade. Because undergraduates and graduate students are
both taking this course, there will be an undergraduate version of the final and a graduate
version of the final. Graduate students will be required to answer an additional question.

This will be an “open book, open note” exam, but students are not allowed to collaborate
with one other, to communicate with others outside the class during the exam, or to use
any internet resource other than the class website.

Optional review sessions: The TA will hold optional review sessions for students from
time to time throughout the semester, although these review sessions will not meet every
week. The location and timing of these sessions will be announced later in the term.

Students are strongly encouraged (but not required) to attend these sessions when they
are held.

Respect for Diversity: This course is premised on the belief that policy courses which
draw exclusively from the experience of the United States or Western European countries
omit much that is relevant from the human experience and from the policy record. This
course is deliberately designed to consider the lessons that the economic growth of Asian
economies provides for the rest of the world. The set of guest speakers includes eminent
experts born outside the United States, some of whom have held high-ranking advisory
positions in Asian governments, enabling them to provide a non-Western perspective on
contemporary policy debates. It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds
and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed
both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
as a resource, strength and benefit. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. In
addition, if any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me
know so that we can make arrangements for you.

General Class Etiquette
Students are welcome to bring reasonable amounts of food and drink to class.

Students are allowed to use laptops in class for the purposes of taking notes or engaging
with the class material. Please do not use class time to check e-mail, trade stocks, or play
video games.

Students are encouraged to show our guest speakers courtesy and respect. The experts
participating in videoconferences are doing us the enormous favor of contributing their
experience and insight to our class discussions without any direct compensation from
Carnegie Mellon. You are welcome to pose “challenging” questions to our guest
speakers, but you are strongly encouraged to do so in a respectful way, recognizing that
access of future student generations to these practitioners will be, in part, a function of
the quality of their experience interacting with you and your classmates.

Likewise, students are expected to show one another similar courtesy and respect in
classroom discussions. Students are welcome – indeed, encouraged – to “challenge” one
another’s ideas in class, as well as the positions taken by the instructor. However,
students are expected to do so in a way that maintains an atmosphere of civility and
mutual respect.

All sources used for written assignments must be appropriately cited based on standard
citation guidelines and CMU policies. Students are responsible for knowing how to cite
sources appropriately. For official CMU definitions of cheating and plagiarism, and
academic disciplinary procedures that will be followed in the case of a violation, see:
http://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academicintegrity.html. Plagiarism is a serious offense that can result in the student failing
the course. Note that all academic integrity violations will be reported to the Associate
Dean. Additional penalties may be imposed. See me if you have any questions about
appropriate citation before handing in an assignment.

If you have a disability and are registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I
encourage you to use their online system to notify me of your accommodations and
discuss your needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to
ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may
have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with
the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them
at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Please do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well,
exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking some time to
relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. If any student has to
miss an exam or is unable to complete a homework assignment on time due to illness,
that student should contact the instructor and TA as soon as possible and be prepared to
provide a note from their healthcare provider verifying the illness.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or
feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and
