## Course Information

**Units:** 6

## Description

This course focuses on the fundamentals of computer programming using the Python interpreted programming language. This course is designed for students with little or no programming knowledge. Students will develop their problem solving skills using the top-down procedural programming approach to build standalone software applications. Assignments will include weekly homework, bi-weekly checkpoint quizzes, and a final examination to test essential programming and problem solving skills. Some OOP (object oriented programming) will be used in this course. Learners will study how to build professional, user-friendly computer programs applicable to real-world usage in such areas as public policy and security analysis. Please note: Students who have taken this course should not take Data Focused Python. After completing 90-812, if you are interested in building on your programming with Python experience, please register for 90-819 Python Programming II.
