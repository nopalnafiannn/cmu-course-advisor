Description 90-798/88-344: Environmental Policy and Planning provides an introduction to how
environmental policies have been and can be designed/created, implemented, and evaluated
amidst complex information-based, social, political, and cultural processes. The course
emphasizes a systems-based methodological approach for addressing the complexities
involved in framing, analyzing, and designing an implementation plan for policy construction.

The course also explores through landmark and contemporary case studies several dimensions
of environmental policymaking:
### *  Contextual, historical, and structural aspects of environmental policymaking at the

local, state, federal, and international levels
### *  Use of quantitative and qualitative analytical tools (from core program + new tools)

*  The process of how policies derive their meanings.
*  Contemporary challenges and opportunities in environmental policymaking.
*  Strategies for successful policymaking in the contemporary landscape.

The course includes experiential, hands-on learning (projects, case studies, analyses,
presentations, and guest lectures) as well as reflective components (readings, discussion, and

papers). Students in this course work on a final environmental policy project to demonstrate
mastery of the knowledge and skill-based exercises explored during the term.
### By the end of the course, each student will be able to:

### *  Learn and deploy a systems-based approach towards structuring and analyzing an

environmental policy decision situation;
### *  Connect several analytical tools to policymaking processes, such as rate and weight

decision methods, optimization, decision analysis and decision trees, economic modeling,
and decisions under uncertainty;
### *  Evaluate and design potential alternative policy solutions; and

### *  Propose strategic ways of engaging with social and political processes in order to advance

policy solution goals.
*  Assess how the courses tools relate to career goals and objectives.

Academic
Integrity, *  I expect that all work students submit for this course will be their own. I have
Plagiarism, and
carefully designed all assignments and class activities to support your learning. Doing
Cheating Notice
your own work is best for your achievement of the learning objectives in this course.

In instances when collaborative work is assigned, I expect for the submitted work to
list all team members who participated.
*  Plagiarism: All work in this class must be your own. It is unprofessional to copy or
use another person’s materials or ideas without proper attribution to that person.

Plagiarism ruins the careers of professionals, and also is in violation of University
policy. If you have questions about proper attribution, do not hesitate to contact me
for help.
### *  Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are taken extremely

seriously. Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as
among the most serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as
plagiarism on a required paper or assignment or as cheating on an examination,
regardless of whether it is a take-home or in-class examination. The punishment for
such offenses can involve expulsion from the program. There are many other ways in
which a violation can occur.
### *  Academic Dishonesty: Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards

inside and outside the classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e. plagiarism
and unauthorized collaboration) is obviously discouraged and will be treated
appropriately. The usual penalty for violations is a failing grade for the particular
assignment in question; however, in some instances, such actions may result in a
failing grade for the course.
### *  Academic integrity governs the way in which classwork, writing, and research are

done at a University. It is founded on the principles of respect for knowledge, truth,
scholarship, and acting with honesty. These principles and values are the foundation
of academia and are especially important to Carnegie Mellon with its mission of
providing public and private sector education for professionals. Academic integrity is
essential for all students and it is the responsibility of all faculty members to provide
learning environments that foster and enforce academic integrity. As per university
rules, faculty must report all incidents to the appropriate associate dean in which there
is sufficient evidence that a student or students have broached academic integrity by
cheating or plagiarism.
*  90-789 Students: Please visit the Heinz College Student Handbook, CHAPTER 16,
“ETHICS AND DISCIPLINE,” for guidance on issues related to academic integrity,
as these policies are in effect in this course: https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/heinzshared/_files/img/student-handbooks/heinz-college-student-handbook.pdf
*  90-489 Students: Please visit the Carnegie Mellon University Policy on Academic
Integrity for guidance on issues related to academic integrity, as these policies are in
effect in this course: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academicintegrity.html
Guidance for Proper citation and formatting of sources are central to meeting the requirements of academic
Citation of Sources integrity. Here are some recommended guidelines. This course recommends using the APA Style
### Guide; however, you may choose any of the following styles if you are consistent in their use:

*  American Psychological Association (APA) Style: https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammarguidelines
### *  Modern Language Association (MLA)

style: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_
guide/mla_general_format.html
*  Chicago Manual of Style: https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citationguide-1.html
Use of Generative These tools are forbidden to be used for the midterm exam, final presentation, and final
AI Programs reflection paper.

Generative AI programs (ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc.) can serve as useful references for case
assignments and for supporting your research project. The content generated from these
sources are not substitutes for your own research, generative thinking, analysis, expression,
synthesis or reasoned arguments.

You must follow the academic integrity guidelines of the university and of this class. If
you use one of these generative AI tools to develop content for an assignment, you are
required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work.

Treat information from these tools as if they are like the sharing of an algorithm’s output
(because that is what it is).

Any such use must be appropriately acknowledged and cited, following the guidelines
established by the APA Style Guide (or equivalent in MLA or Chicago styles), including the
specific version of the tool used.

Submitted work should include the exact prompt used to generate the content as well as
the AI’s full response in an Appendix.

Following the APA Style Guide, the proper handling of the citation is to give credit to the
author of the algorithm. Include this information as an entry in a reference list. Provide a
corresponding in-text citation. The results should be acknowledged as a source and checked
for validity and credibility with your own additional research.

Cutting and pasting content from any source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise,
paraphrasing content from a generative AI without citation is plagiarism. Similarly, using
any generative AI tool without appropriate acknowledgement will be treated as
plagiarism. The university’s policy on plagiarism applies to all uncited or improperly cited
use of work, whether that work is created by human beings alone or in collaboration with a
generative AI.
### You may not use generative AI programs to:

o Generate content that you cut and paste into an assignment with a written component
without quotations and a citation and appendix
o Generate content that is not adequately paraphrased without a citation
o Generate bibliographies for topics that you have not researched yourself
o Generate other content (images, video, others) unless expressly permitted and
following provided guidance
o Otherwise use or present generative AI content that you pass off as your own work,
when really it is not
Finally, it is important that you recognize that large language models frequently provide users
with incorrect information, create professional-looking citations that are not real, generate
contradictory statements, incorporate copyrighted material without appropriate attribution, and
can sometimes integrate biased concepts. Code generation models may produce inaccurate
outputs. Image generation models may create misleading or offensive content.

It is important to note that you understand you are ultimately responsible for the content
that you submit. Work that is inaccurate, biased, unethical, offensive, plagiarized, or
incorrect will be penalized.

Course Policies &
Expectations *  Professionalism: Your entire experience is geared toward helping you develop skills
necessary to participate in the world as a qualified professional. This means taking
responsibility for the work that you produce and for your conduct among your student
colleagues and other members of the university community. Quality work in
developing knowledge, skills, and wisdom are the most important goals to keep in
mind. Quantity of product and number of hours spent working are secondary to
overall quality.
*  Attendance: Students are expected to attend all sessions. Students may be excused
from two classes for professional, health, or personal reasons when the instructor is
notified of the pending absence. Attendance performance is used as a multiplying
factor in the final grade.
### *  Participation: It is essential for all students to participate fully in class in their case

evaluation teams. Students will complete a peer evaluation of their team’s
performance. The instructor will note class participation observations. The results of
the evaluation scores are used as a multiplying factor in the final grade, using a
statistical distribution of the scores with mean and cut point performance thresholds
based on standard deviations from mean performance.
*  Recording of Class: Some students find it helpful to record class sessions. Because
there may be times when recording of class may be inappropriate, students must
request the instructor’s permission prior to recording classes. All such recordings are
for personal use. Copies of these recordings may not be distributed to anyone else in
any format or fashion.
*  Contacting me for help: Send me an e-mail to set up an appointment. Email is the
best way to get in contact with me.

Student Well-Being *  We are all under a lot of stress. Make sure to move regularly, eat well, and reach out
to your support system or me (mmehalik@andrew.cmu.edu) if you need to. We can
all benefit from support in times of stress, and this semester is no exception.
### *  The CMU Community Health and Well Being website provides information and

resources for all members of the CMU community:
https://www.cmu.edu/wellbeing/index.html
*  Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by
eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking
some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of
us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many
helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience
is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often
helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life
events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek
support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-2682922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching
out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the
support that can help. If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of
self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night:
CaPS: 412-268-2922
Re:solve Crisis Network: 888-796-8226
### If the situation is life threatening, call the police:

On campus: CMU Police: 412-268-2323
Off campus: 911
If you have questions about this or your coursework, please let me know.
### *  Food Security: If you are worried about affording food or feeling insecure about

food, there are resources on campus that can help. Any undergraduate or graduate
student can visit the CMU Pantry and receive food for free. Follow the directions on
the CMU Pantry website to schedule your visit.

Transferring to *  If the class needs to go fully remote, you will receive an email from me and an
fully remote during announcement will be published on our course website on Canvas.
the semester
Use of technology *  This class involves regular use of technology– both for in-person and remote students.
during class Research has shown that divided attention is detrimental to learning, so I encourage
you to close any windows not directly related to what we are doing while you are in
class. Please turn off your phone notifications and limit other likely sources of
technology disruption, so you can fully engage with the material, each other, and me.

Also, if applicable, people in remote mode should have their video turned on during
the entire class time. This will create a better learning environment for everyone. A
laptop will be needed for our in-person classes, so if you do not have access to one,
please email me (mmehalik@andrew.cmu.edu) as soon as possible so we can find a
solution.

Accommodations *  If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability
for students with Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with
disabilities
me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that
accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a
disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the
Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at
access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Diversity statement *  We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and
this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive
campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves,
including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age,
sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or
genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not
mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our
campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only
because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue
justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work,
inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community
that increasingly embraces these core values.
*  Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.
### *  Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or

unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for
individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone
who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to
speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the
incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following
resources:
*  Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 2682150
*  Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a
report by calling 844-587-0793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com.
### *  All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be

any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all
shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.

Recording of class
sessions *  For this course, I will be recording class sessions and making them available to you
for your personal, educational use. Recordings of class sessions are covered under
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and must not be shared
with anyone outside your course-section. The purpose of these recordings is so
students in this course (and only students in this course) can watch or re-watch past
class sessions. Feel free to use the recordings if you would like to review something
we discussed in class or if you are temporarily unable to attend class. The links to the
recorded sessions will be available on Canvas.
### *  If the situation presents itself where we will need to transition to remote learning,

please make sure that your Internet connection and equipment are set up to use Zoom
and able to share audio and video during class meetings. (See this page from
### Computing Resources for information on the technology you are likely to need:

https://www.cmu.edu/computing/start/students.html)
### *  Let me know if there is a gap in your technology set-up

(mmehalik@andrew.cmu.edu) as soon as possible, and we can see about finding
solutions.
### *  Sharing video: In this course, being able to see one another helps to facilitate a better

learning environment and promote more engaging discussions. Therefore, if we are in
remote learning mode, our default will be to expect students to have their cameras on
during lectures and discussions. However, I also completely understand there may be
reasons students would not want to have their cameras on. If you have any concerns
about sharing your video, please email me as soon as possible
(mmehalik@andrew.cmu.edu) and we can discuss possible adjustments. Note: You
may use a background image in your video if you wish; just check in advance that this
works with your device(s) and internet bandwidth.
### *  If you are logged in remotely during our class meetings, please keep your mic muted

unless you are sharing with the class or your breakout group.
### *  If you have a question or want to answer a question, please use the chat or the "raise

hand" feature. I will be monitoring these channels in order to call on students to
contribute.
### *  Our synchronous meetings may involve breakout room discussions, and those will

work better if everyone in your small group has their camera turned on. During large
group debriefs, you may keep your video off.

Grading policies *  All assignments have due dates indicated on the syllabus. In general, submitting
and late assignments on time lets me provide feedback in a more timely and efficient manner.
assignments
Assignments build on each other, so timely submissions are crucial to your progress
in the class. However, sometimes life happens. If you cannot submit an assignment on
time, the default will be that you will be eligible for 90% of the grade the first 48
hours that the assignment is late. If you have to submit beyond 48 hours past the due
date, please contact me (mmehalik@andrew.cmu.edu) as soon as possible so we can
make arrangements.
