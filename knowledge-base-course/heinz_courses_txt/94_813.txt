# 94-813: Project Management

## Course Information

**Units:** 6

## Description

NOTE: This is a flipped course. Many lectures will be watched asynchronously before class. During class, we will discuss core concepts, conduct exercises, and discuss cases. As organizations continue to look for ways to reduce costs, managers are often expected to oversee special projects in addition to their traditional responsibilities. When a project is too complex for one person to handle, the project manager is expected to lead a team of diverse employees to complete the assignment. This course will assist the project manager to break down a complex project into manageable segments, lead a diverse project team, and use effective tools to ensure that the project meets its deliverables and is completed within budget and on schedule. Over the course of the mini, students will complete a plan for an actual project, giving them valuable experience with the relevant tools and skills, including Microsoft Project software.
