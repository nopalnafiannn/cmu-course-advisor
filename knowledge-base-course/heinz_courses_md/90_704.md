# 90-704: The Racial and Gender Impact of U.S. Social Policies

## Course Information

**Units:** 6

## Description

The goal of this course is to analyze the impact that current U.S. social policies have on reducing poverty and inequality and creating a more just society. The first section discusses the concepts of poverty and inequality, and it is followed by a section on anti-poverty policies pursued in Western Europe. This section includes a discussion of the Welfare State policies in Europe, which have served as a model for universal policies. The bulk of the class is geared to analyzing some of the most critical U.S. social policies including social security, welfare, housing, and health, as well as childcare and child benefits. The policy analysis will emphasize the non-universal nature of the policies and their unequal racial and gender impact. Examples from other countries where those policies have been more successful will be used throughout the class to inform recommendations for better policies. The course will be structured around lectures, class discussions and student presentations.
