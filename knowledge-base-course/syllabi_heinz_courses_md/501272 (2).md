Course Description
Centered within the intersection of research and futurism, this course is designed in a studio model in
which students gain an understanding of how to conduct deep research while considering the changes
affecting the artists and organizations of our industries – from emerging technologies to social justice to
climate change, geopolitical instability or the growing wealth gap’s impact. This course also teaches
how to create digital content – from web sites to podcasts with the assumption that meaningful
research produces new ideas that gain greater meaning by being shared. Content creation has become
a core activity of both individuals and businesses. Research-driven content is a key component and
strategy of most consulting firms, arts organizations, and some artists (eg Jenny O’Dell). Hence, this
course provides you with a research-based content creation model focusing on the arts and
entertainment enterprises across the globe. Students simultaneously learn and experiment with how to
create content using multi-modal, trans-media digital storytelling methods often fueled by AI while
learning how to frame and conduct meaningful professional research. Research findings are created
with a specific intended audience: followers of Arts Management and Technology, curated by a studentmanaged team that serves artists and arts professionals working in the field.

This class is designed to provide a breadth of skills that will serve emerging professionals. With a focus
on digital modes of research and communication, young professionals leave the course with effective
skills to communicate evidence-supported ideas to peers, supervisors, or customers. Furthermore,
current and future leaders need to understand how to evaluate or conduct research using the most
effective and efficient tools in order to address emerging opportunities.

Adopting a studio model, students will spend time outside of class time gaining an understanding of
critical and practical tools for research and digital publication. In class, students will work actively to
synthesize this work, from creating an evidenced-based infographic to scripting and recording a podcast
episode.

Each student will be working on an independent project with the arts at the core. A list of potential, but
not prescribed research topics are provided at the beginning of the semester and all assignments
scaffold from inception to final digital products.

Course Requirements
### Classroom and Online Engagement

At the graduate level, attendance is assumed, except in extraordinary circumstances. Should such
circumstances arise (illness, earthquake, etc.), please make every effort to let me know by phone or
email before class begins. The course is run in a STUDIO / quasi-production house style embracing a
post-covid distributed work environment.

Active class participation is required. The class will offer opportunities to learn in an active and
synergistic manner. Class time will include a discussion of assigned readings, in-class hands-on learning,
round round-robin share-outs of research.
### WEEKLY EXPECTATIONS:

## 1. Class preparation: prior to class read/watch/listen to any indicated readings, videos or audio

files with questions or thoughts pulled out ready for submission on Discussion Board to allow for
curated in-class discussion
## 2. Weekly News (12 pts = 12 weeks of participation)

a. Each week, you are to post a piece of content as prompted in the schedule. It is often
about an emerging technology or issue found in your research journey. On a few
occasions, you will be directed to find a non-news-related piece as part of the weekly
prompt. The piece needs to have been published WITHIN THE LAST 18 MONTHS, and
you should also include why you picked it (what makes it interesting) AND a CHICAGO
STYLE bibliographic citation for practice. You have 2 weeks you can ‘skip’ that align with
your excused absences. Additional weeks can earn up to 4% for this portion of the class
work.
## 3. Class Preparation Thoughts 12 pts = 12 weeks of participation)

a. Each week you are expected to contribute to class 1 - 2 questions or discussion areas
you would like us to focus on in class. These ideas should be the ideas or your take on
the material prepared for class that day. How does it affect you? What questions do you
have? This is not a summary of what you read but 2 - 5 sentences incorporating your
questions and thoughts into the preparatory materials. We will use a class Google doc
for these efforts.
## 4. Weekly work plan (12 pts = 12 weeks of active engagement with our work.)

a. At the conclusion of each day, we will end class with time to consider the work you’ve
accomplished thus far and what you plan to do in the following week. The reflection
can / should include pictures (or screenshots) of your in-class work and a wrap-up
thought (2 – 3 sentences) of how the day’s activities contributed to your understanding
of your particular work and how it affects your plans for the future.

Assignments
## 1. Student-defined objectives [and outcomes if opting for a personalized rubric] as framed by the

course structure and objectives
a. Reflection #1
## 2. Research proposal (optional miro visualization) and accompanying preliminary bibliography

## 3. Review of Literature: multi-modal summary of research on the topic that frames the study. It should

be built out on Square Space with FULL bibliography provided (NOT JUST works cited); This offers a
practice with Square Space and multi-modal writing prior to your final project.
a. Reflection #2 + midpoint evaluation form
## 4. Final Project: The final project complete on Square Space, ready for review for publication*

## 5. Podcast Script and recording (small group project)

## 6. Final Reflection #3

All assignments tie into the individual research work conducted by the student. Weekly news can help
stimulate ideas in the first week. Additionally, Dr. Crawford’s Flipboards have noteworthy / newsworthy
materials as do the resource links to follow above. As you move through your research, note that
www.amt-lab.org should also be searched by your topic to catch you up on what has been done to date
on that topic. A good place to find additional resources in previous research bibliographies.
*AMT Lab Final Publication Process: The instructor provides feedback as part of the process.

Sometimes the student will be asked to add images, urls or update some aspect of the work. Once
approved by the publisher, and cleared for publication, the Chief Editor provides editing and feedback
and finishes /supports formatting on the platform. STUDENTS SHOULD SAVE NOT PUBLISH WHEN
WORKING IN SQUARE SPACE.
### Definition of roles for AMT Lab:

Dr. Brett Ashley Crawford is both faculty instructor and Executive Director for the AMT Lab platform. As
publisher she identifies content as ‘ready’ for fine-tune editing by the editor. All grading for the course
will be conducted by the Instructor.

The Chief Editor works with the ED to determine the research scope and editorial calendar. They work
with all contributors in shaping the written product and edits all writing assignments and other content
for publication. 2024 Chief Editor is Hanna Brainard.

Additional staff of AMT Lab include the Social Media and Marketing Coordinator (Sofia Akhmanaeva)
who works with AMT Lab contributors, the publisher and the editor to market AMT Lab across all social
media channels, the Technology Manager (Jinghong Gong) who works with the AMT Lab team to publish

Grading Scale*
You earn points through thoughtful weekly work plans, weekly news, class questions, and reflections.

The larger research work is evaluated via a standard rubric with the potential to augment individually
with your course goals stated in Reflection #1. Specifically, should you choose to do so, you will
establish specific benchmarks and measures tied to accompanying assignments’ rubrics. Reflections,
self-evaluation, and a minimum of 1 meeting held with the professor during which you determine your
grade for each assignment and the final grade for the class. This is a collaborative form of the
‘ungrading’ model and can be opted in for a self-determined portion of your final grade.

A+ 99-100% C+ 78-80.9%
A 94-98.9% C 74-77.9%
A- 91-93.9% C- 71-73.9%
B+ 88 - 90.9% R 70.9% and below
B 84-87.9%
B- 81-83.9%
Late work: As the class follows an ungrading model, the discussion boards, class questions, and
reflections are due on the day of the class at the indicated time. Accountability and promptness are
expected, and a zero is given for any weekly work missed or late. Research project assignments and
podcast have a 48 hour grace period if requested prior to the day it is due.
### Course & Classroom Policies and Expectations

Class etiquette (also see Respect and Support)
Please turn off your cell phone and put it away during class. A class is like a performance. At times, I am
the performer, and you are the audience. At other times, you will be the performer and the rest of class
and myself will be your audience. Respect is simple.

Similarly, computers are useful but distracting tools. Education science has a preponderance of
evidence that reveals how computer use during class diminishes comprehension and retention. While
you will need your computer for in-class work at times, when not required you should leave your
computer in your bag. When used for in-class work, be mindful of their use and utilize focus features to
decrease their distractions.

Recording Class Sessions. Classes will not be recorded unless due to Covid Protocols or a student’s
prolonged absence due to acute health situation. Should we pivot to Zoom we will also be following a
shared set of Digital Agreements for Zoom protocols (reviewed should the situation arrive).

Food/Drink. You are permitted to eat and drink in class as long as you do not disrupt others in the class
and, of course, clean up and dispose of any trash after class and abide by whatever is in effect for CMU
food and masking protocols.
### Intellectual and Professional Integrity

This course is an integral part of your graduate education, an education that is designed to provide you
with the tools for a successful, professional career. Assumed within is a high standard of ethics and
integrity. You are expected to have read and understood the CMU, Heinz College and MAM Student
Handbooks. Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely serious
matters. Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most
serious violations. Cases of cheating and plagiarism will follow the requirements as described in the
handbook. Each and every case will be submitted to and reviewed by the Office of Community
Standards and Integrity where more severe penalties may be imposed, up to and including expulsion
from the university. Any assignment that involves cheating or plagiarism will receive a ‘zero’ for the
assignment. Two confirmed cases of cheating or plagiarism will result in an ‘R’ for the course.

In addition to the guidelines concerning work materials, you are expected to behave in a supportive and
professional manner towards your colleagues/classmates; this includes sharing resources for mutual
benefit, protecting information told in confidence, and helping to create a general classroom climate of
honesty and respect.

NOTE: All work for this course is to be done with directed feedback from peers, but otherwise 100% on
your own.

Artificial Intelligence
AI will be introduced and may be used as a component of the course, but any use of AI in the work you
turn in should be indicated clearly, including the tool, the prompts, and how you incorporated it. If your
AI work is not indicated or cited, that is plagiarism and will be treated accordingly.

Respect and Support
In addition to the guidelines concerning work materials, you are expected to behave in a supportive and
professional manner towards your colleagues/classmates; this includes sharing resources for mutual
benefit, protecting information told in confidence, and helping to create a general classroom climate of
honesty and respect.

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds, identities, and perspectives be well served by
this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity
that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. Your suggestions are
encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for
you personally or for other students or student groups. In addition, if any of our class meetings conflict
with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements for you.

All people have the right to be addressed and referred to in accordance with their personal identity. In
this class, we will have the chance to indicate the name that we prefer to be called and the pronouns by
which should be used to refer to us. I will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly and
support classmates in doing so as well.

During the first day of class, we will review the course’s inclusive behavior agreements and edit to meet
the course expectations.
### Special Needs and Interests

My goal is to provide the most effective educational atmosphere for all students. The university provides
significant support should you find yourself struggling with writing through the Student Success Center.

Time management and other support is included in the overall purview of the Student Academic Success
Center (SASC). Some students also find do to their unique circumstances that working with Disability
Resources can provide approaches and accommodations to support
success.https://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/
Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well,
exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. The last few
years have been unusually stressful. Self-care will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful
resources available on campus and an important part of a professional education experience is learning
how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety
or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS)
is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider
reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support
that can help.
### How to succeed in this course:

The key to success in this course is Preparation and Showing Up – by reading/viewing / listening to the
day’s learning materials PRIOR to class you will be best situated to ENGAGE with your peers and in-class
activities. The class assignments build on the knowledge gained during class and in preparation
materials. By gaining proficiency throughout, success in larger assignments is smoother.

Additionally, keeping in communication with your professor along the way is critical to success. If you
have questions – ask them. If you need support, we are here for you.

Finally, time management allows for the preparation, work, and, when necessary, request for
extensions. If you are struggling with time management, please let us know and reach out to the
Student Success Center.
