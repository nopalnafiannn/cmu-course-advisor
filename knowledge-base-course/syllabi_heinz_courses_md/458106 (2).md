Course Objectives
### At the end of this course, you should be able to:

### *  Create and interpret graphs of sample data

### *  Summarize a set of observations by reporting central tendency measures

### *  Explain what sampling error is and why it exists

### *  Identify the proper summary statistics and tests for each data type

### *  Interpret the p-value and use it to conclude about the test statistic

### *  Explain what it means if test results or poll differences are statistically significant

### *  Interpret the output from a test of hypothesis and confidence interval

### *  Identify the dependent and independent variables and the output of regression analysis

Course Organization
The course is divided into three units.
## Unit 1 focuses on the descriptive analysis of data. We will explore tools for describing and summarizing

data,suchasgraphs,tables,andsummarystatistics. Attheendoftheunit,wewillstudyprobabilitytheory,
which will allow us to make scientific estimates and draw conclusions from sample data.
## Unit 2 focuses on how to make inferences about larger populations that we cannot fully observe. We will

make estimates about the population with some degree of confidence and allowance for error. We will also
testhypothesesaboutthecharacteristicsofthelargerpopulationandcometoscientificconclusions. Wewill
discuss real-life applications of population studies.
## Unit 3 will focus on regression analysis. In this unit, we will learn to identify and model the relationships between variables. We will create linear models and use inferential statistics to make estimates and

conclusions about the population studied.

Class expectations
### Attendance:

Lectures: Everyone is expected to attend – and participate in – lectures. Students may miss four lecture
with no penalty. Every additional missed class will have a penalty of 10 points in the final grade of the
class. If you anticipate more absences, please let me know as early as possible. During the lectures, we will

workonsimpleexampleproblemsthatwillhelpyouunderstandthematerial. Iwillteachthematerialusing
lecture slides and whiteboard explanations. If you miss a class, you are responsible for checking the lecture
slides on Canvas and obtaining any additional class material from another student or me. You can request
the material from me through email or in person at office hours. Beware that the material of this course is
cumulative. Thus,catchingupontimewillallowyoutofollowupintheclassesfollowingtheoneyoumissed.

Recitationsessions(Fridays): Recitationsessionsareweeklyspacesledbytheteachingassistantswhere

experienceandinteractwithotherstudents. Ontheweekbeforeeachexam(Week5,Week11,andWeek15)
wearegoingtoworkonacasestudytogetsomepracticebeforetheexam. Attendance is mandatory for
these case study sessions (Week 5, Week 11, and Week 15). For the other recitation sessions, attendance
is not mandatory but highly encouraged. While TAs will not solve the homework or problem sets for you,
they can help you understand the concept. If you decide to not attend, you still have to submit on time the
recitation problem set assigned for the week.

Classroom behavior: Please arrive on time. If you arrive after the class has started, please enter quietly
to avoid distracting other students and interrupting the lecture. If you arrive more than 20 minutes late to
the class, it will count as a missed lecture. Laptops, and ipads are permitted in class for taking notes or
for class activities. Please refrain from using cellphones or electronics for other purposes during class. This
might distract other students and keep you from fully understanding the material.

Participation: The class is going to be a combination of lectures and in-class activities. Participation is
highly encouraged to keep the class interactive. All questions are good questions. You are all here to learn
and your question might help other students. We are all responsible for creating a safe and collaborative
learning environment. For doing so, I expect you to respect each other learning process.

Communication: Ifyouneedtocommunicatewithme,pleasecometomyofficehoursorsendmeanemail.

If you have time conflicts with my office hours, email me and we can arrange another time. I am committed
to replying to your emails within 24 hours on weekdays. For emails sent after 6:00 pm on Fridays, please
allow until Monday morning. If you have clarification questions of the material or the assignments, please
use Piazza on Canvas. Other students might have the same question as you.

Assessment
Homework (80 points): To gain hands-on learning experience, you will have weekly homework. The
homework consists of solving short problems based on key material of the course that will prepare you for
problem sets and exams. Homework will cover the topics of the week they are posted.

Homework will be published on Thursdays at 5 p.m., and you should submit them by Mondays at 3:30 pm.

At the end of the semester, the eight homework assignments with the highest scores will be considered for
the final grade. Solutions will be posted the day after the deadline for the homework. To keep the class on
track, no late homework will be accepted. If you have an emergency, please contact me through email and
we can make arrangements for your submission.

Problem sets (150 points): There are five problem sets throughout the semester, two for units one and
two, and one for unit three. Problem sets will cover the same topics as homework but at a more challenging
level to help you prepare and study for the exam. Problem sets can be handwritten or typed and should be
uploaded to Gradescope by the deadline.

Problem sets will be accepted up to 24 hours after the deadline. However, late assignments will only be
eligiblefor80%ofthetotalgrade. Forexample, ifyouget40points, yourfinalgradefortheassignmentwill
be 32. No credit will be given for an assignment submitted more than 24 hours late unless you have made
special arrangements with me in advance. I understand occasional emergencies can happen, so please notify
me as soon as possible. You can contact me through email or in person in my office.

Exams (300 points): There will be three individual exams, one for each unit. Exams 1 and 2 will be
given in class on week 6 and week 12, respectively, and will have a duration of 80 minutes. Please check the
Course Plan section at the end of this syllabus for the specific date for your section. The final exam will
be given in finals week (12/11 to 12/15), during the time period scheduled by the university. Exams must
be taken at the scheduled time and they will have a duration of 80 minutes. If there is an extraordinary
circumstance that prevents you from presenting the exam at the scheduled time, please notify me as soon
as possible to coordinate a make-up exam. The make-up exam will happen no more than one week after
the originally scheduled date and might have different questions to preserve a fair environment. Exams will
consist of problem sets and short answer questions that will test your understanding of the course material.

The material of the course is, by nature, comprehensive. For this reason, the exams are also comprehensive.

However, there will be a higher focus on the material covered since the prior exam. You can bring a nonprogrammable calculator and the formula sheet available on Canvas with handwritten notes to use during
the exams. More details will be given near the exam dates.

Recitation session practice problems (50 points): Every week you will have practice problems to
gain hands-on experience solving problems. You will have to submit by Saturday at midnight the assigned
problems. Recitationsessionproblemsetsarearesourceforyoutopractice,thus,theproblemsetsaregoing
to be graded on completeness rather than correctness. Solutions will be posted on Saturday mornings.

RecitationsessionCaseStudies(60points): Onweek5(09/27),week11(11/08),andweek15(12/06),
you will work in a case study that will help you see the concepts apply to a real-world problem. You must
attend the recitation session and submit the case study by the end of class.

Reflection statement (15 points): At the end of the semester you will submit a one-page reflection
statement on the use of statistics in your future career. More details about the assignment will be available
on Canvas.

Regrade policy: We are committed to returning work to you as quickly as possible. Our goal is to grade
assignments and return them within 1 week of the due date. All appeals for grading must be made within
2 weeks of the due date of the assignments. The appeal must be written and include the number of the
questionwiththespecificreasonwhyyoubelievethegradeisincorrect. Youmustsubmitthewrittenappeal
to me during office hours or after class. Please check the solution before appealing.

Performance evaluation
The final grade for the course will consist of grades from the items mentioned above. Your final grade will
be determined by your point placement on the following scale:
622 or more A 550-569 B 478-497 C
# 590-621 A- 524-549 B- 458-477 C570-589 B+ 498-523 C+ 0-457 R

Be aware that I do not round up. That means that to pass the course you need 458 or more points. This
applies to all the items on the placement scale. For example, if you get a 621.8 in the class, your grade will
be an A-. You need 622 or more to get an A.

Academic Integrity
Working with other students for assignments and problem sets is allowed. I encouraged you to get together and work on the problems. However, you must write your own solution and mention the students
you collaborated with and the external resources you used, such as “I collaborated with (student name)
on this homework”. To guarantee that you understand the material, I recommend you sit down alone
after the study session with your peers and write your solution. Do not copy homework from another student or from and AI generator. Sharing your solutions with other students is not allowed. In accordance

with CMU policy, it is the responsibility of each student to produce her/his own original academic work.
(https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html) If there is evidence that
you copy from another student or/and shared your solution all the students involved will receive zero credit
for the assignment and face academic sanctions according to the University policies. You are encouraged
and expected to familiarize yourself with the University policy. If you have any questions please contact me
or the TAs.

In this class we are focused on learning fundamental statistics. I expect that all the work students submit is
their own. I have designed all assignments to support your learning. Working on the assignment, without
any AI generator, is best for your learning process. Please refrain from using AI tools (such as ChatGPT)
to generate ANY content for an assignment. Passing off any AI generated content as your own constitutes
a violation of CMU’s academic integrity policy. If there is evidence that you used an AI generator, all
the students involved will receive zero credit for the assignment and face academic sanctions according to
University policies.

Other information
Accommodation
If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage
you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work
with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a
disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability
Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Well being
Graduateschoolcanbechallengingattimes. Makesuretotaketimeforyourselfanddoactivitiesyouenjoy.

The University Provost provides the following thoughts that I believe are important to share.

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve
your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus
and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner
rather than later is almost always helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is
here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website athttp://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reachingouttoafriend, facultyorfamilymemberyoutrustforhelpgettingconnectedtothesupportthatcanhelp.

Inclusion and Diversity
We must treat every individual with respect. We at Heinz College are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Inclusion
is ensuring everyone feels respected in the environments they interact with other. Diversity, can be broadly
defined as the presence of people who identify with multiple attributes, these include but are not limited to
race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed,
ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many
others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. I
will work to promote and create an inclusive and equitable learning environment. I understand that diverse
backgrounds require different learning tools and I am committed to provide each of you with the tools you
need to grow and learn in my class.

We, atCMU,willworktopromotediversity, equityandinclusionnotonlybecausediversityfuelsexcellence
andinnovation,butbecausewewanttopursuejustice. Weacknowledgeourimperfectionswhilewealsofully
commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community
that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive
environment. The university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on
the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the
incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:
*  Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
*  Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a report by calling 844587-0793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com.

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to
be more equitable and just.
