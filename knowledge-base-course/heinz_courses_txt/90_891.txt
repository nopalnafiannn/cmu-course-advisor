## Course Information

**Units:** 12

## Description

Businesses and organizations—from tech companies to non-profits to governments—increasingly use experiments to learn what policies and practices to implement. Why are experiments so useful? How can we design experiments to learn what works best for companies, employees, customers, or citizens? This course is designed to help you understand the why and how of designing experiments to solve real-world problems. We'll focus on practical issues that arise at each stage of the process—from deciding the right question to ask, to ensuring you have the right kind and amount of data, to understanding what you can learn (and can't learn) from the results—illustrating each lesson by examining real-life experiments within organizations.
