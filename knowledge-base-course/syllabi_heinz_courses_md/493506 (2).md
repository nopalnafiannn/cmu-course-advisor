Description Many music industry executives assert that while the top 5% of music artists can still make money selling
records, the other 95% go on tour. The changes in the music industry have affected everything from how
people listen to their favorite artists to the profit revenue streams for labels, promoters, and artists.

This course will examine the live music touring industry on various levels, from DIY to mid-level road dogs,
to arena giants. There will also be a focus on the personnel behind a successful tour including the
management team, booking agents, promoters, publicists, venue owners, roadies, and technicians. We’ll
discuss life on the road from the artist’s perspective and how each team member can best interact with and
support the artist. Students will be able to understand the practical aspects of touring deals and the
intricacies of a tour budget. Students will also work to identify and optimize touring monetization and
identify best practices for promotion and merchandising, including the importance of sponsorship and
branding.
*Course material will reflect a pre-COVID-19 live music and touring world with discussions addressing the
impact and implications of the pandemic and other recent events.

Absences / Tardy: Each class gives the foundation of knowledge you need for the next week. Under normal circumstances
attendance is mandatory. However, exceptions can be made in extenuating circumstances with proper
communication and remediation.

If you know you are going to be late or absent, please contact both me and our TA, Christi, before class via
email: [cwelter@alumni.cmu.edu AND eberlin@andrew.cmu.edu]
After a missed class you will be required to review the class materials as soon as possible and complete any
assignments within the specified time period. Failure to take the above measures will be reflected in the
class participation portion of your grade and may have an adverse effect on your grade.

Each unexcused absence, unexcused lateness or unexcused early exit from class will result in a comparable
reduction in class participation grade (a one-third step down in grade (e.g., A- to B+). An absent student
who misses a graded class activity, without prior notification or any attempt to remediate within 48 hours,
will be given no credit for that activity.

Grading Policy All assignments have due dates indicated on the syllabus. In general, submitting assignments on time lets
the instructional team provide feedback in a more timely and efficient manner. Assignments build on each
other, so timely submissions are crucial to your progress in the class. However, sometimes life happens. If
you cannot submit an assignment on time, the default will be that you will be eligible for 90% of the grade
the first 48 hours after the due date/time.

Assignments submitted later than that will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, no credit is guaranteed. If
you need to submit beyond 48 hours past the due date/time, please contact us as soon as possible so we
can make arrangements [cwelter@alumni.cmu.edu AND eberlin@andrew.cmu.edu].

Units and Quality Carnegie Mellon has adopted the method of assigning a number of “units” for each course to represent the
Points quantity of work required of students. For mini courses that run for only seven weeks, the conversion from
units to the number of hours per week during the mini involves multiplying by 2. For example, a 6-unit mini
course should on average involve 12 hours of student engagement. In this case the instructor requires 3
hours of in-class time, allowing the students to spend 9 hours outside of class per week. This much time will
not be necessary every week, but it is a possibility for some weeks, especially leading up to the final project
submission and presentation.

Accommodations If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage
for Students with you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will do my
Disabilities best to work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate.

If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet
registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them
at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Plagiarism and In any manner of presentation, it is the responsibility of each student to produce her/his own original
cheating notice academic work. Collaboration or assistance on academic work to be graded is not permitted unless
explicitly authorized by the course instructor(s). Students may utilize the assistance provided by the Student
Academic Success Center and the Academic Resource Center (CMU-Q) unless specifically prohibited by the
course instructor(s). Any other sources of collaboration or assistance must be specifically authorized by the
course instructor(s).

In all academic work to be graded, citations of all sources are required. When collaboration or assistance is
permitted by the course instructor(s) or when a student utilizes the services provided by the Student
Academic Success Center and the Academic Resource Center (CMU-Q), the acknowledgment of any
collaboration or assistance is likewise required. This citation and acknowledgment must be incorporated
into the work submitted and not separately or at a later point in time. Failure to do so is dishonest and is
subject to disciplinary action.

Cheating occurs when a student avails her/himself of an unfair or disallowed advantage which includes but
is not limited to:
● Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam, answer key, or other graded work from previous
course offerings.
● Use of an alternate, stand-in, or proxy during an examination.
● Copying from the examination or work of another person or source.
● Submission or use of falsified data.
● Using false statements to obtain additional time or other accommodation.
● Falsification of academic credentials.

Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals without proper
attribution or citation. Unique ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use
must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be graded. Examples of sources expected to be referenced
include but are not limited to:
● Text, either written or spoken, quoted directly or paraphrased.
● Graphic elements.
● Passages of music, existing either as sound or as notation.
● Mathematical proofs.
● Scientific data.
● Concepts or material derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another person.

Unauthorized assistance refers to the use of sources of support that have not been specifically authorized in
this policy statement or by the course instructor(s) in the completion of academic work to be graded. Such
sources of support may include but are not limited to advice or help provided by another individual,
published or unpublished written sources, electronic sources, and generative AI tools. Examples of
unauthorized assistance include but are not limited to:
● Collaboration on any assignment beyond the standards authorized by this policy statement and the
course instructor(s).
● Submission of work completed or edited in whole or in part by another person.
● Supplying or communicating unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and
answer keys from previous course offerings, in any way to another student.
● Use of unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer keys from
previous course offerings.
● Use of unauthorized devices.
● Submission for credit of previously completed graded work in a second course without first
obtaining permission from the instructor(s) of the second course. In the case of concurrent
courses, permission to submit the same work for credit in two courses must be obtained from the
instructors of both courses.
● AI derived material (when not authorized, more on this below)

Cheating and/or plagiarism on any assignment will result in a failing grade (0 points) for that assignment.

The assignment in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the offending student's grade
calculations; the points for that assignment – zero (0) – will be factored into the grade.

Furthermore, the cheating student’s final grade will be reduced by one full letter grade. A cheating
student’s final grade will be impacted significantly. In addition, cases of cheating and plagiarism will be
submitted to and reviewed by the Dean’s Office; more severe penalties may be imposed, up to and
including expulsion from the Heinz School.

Student Use of Generative AI programs (ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc.) can be powerful tools for learning and other productive
Generative AI pursuits, including completing some assignments in less time, helping you generate new ideas, or serving as
Tools a personalized learning tool.

Certain assignments in this course will permit or even encourage the use of generative artificial intelligence
(AI) tools, such as ChatGPT. When AI use is permissible, it will be clearly stated in the assignment prompt
posted in Canvas. Otherwise, the default is that use of generative AI is disallowed. In assignments where
generative AI tools are allowed, their use must be appropriately acknowledged and cited. For instance, if
you generated the whole document through ChatGPT and edited it for accuracy, your submitted work
would need to include a note such as “I generated this work through Chat GPT and edited the content for
accuracy.” Paraphrasing or quoting smaller samples of AI-generated content must be appropriately
acknowledged and cited, following the guidelines established by the APA Style Guide. Each student’s
responsible for assessing the validity and applicability of any submitted AI output. You may not earn full
credit if inaccurate or invalid information is found in your work. Deviations from the guidelines above will
be considered violations of CMU’s academic integrity policy.

It is also important to recognize the limitations of generative AI tools. While they can assist with
brainstorming, drafting, and ideation, they are not infallible. These tools often produce information that
appears polished but may be inaccurate, outdated, biased, or contradictory. AI tools may also generate
citations that look legitimate but do not correspond to real sources. You are responsible for verifying the
accuracy of any AI-generated content and ensuring it meets the academic standards of this course.

Additionally, reliance on generative AI should not replace the development of your own critical thinking,
analytical, and research skills. While AI tools can enhance your work, your personal engagement with the
material, original ideas, and thoughtful analysis remain essential components of learning. Assignments are
designed not just to assess your final product, but also to help you build the skills and understanding
needed for success in this course and beyond.

Ultimately, you are responsible for ensuring the quality, integrity, and accuracy of your submitted work.

Expectations for plagiarism, cheating, and acceptable assistance on student work may vary across courses
and instructors. If you're uncertain about what's permissible for a particular assignment or how to use
generative AI, please reach out for clarification. It's better to ask questions in advance than to risk a
misunderstanding regarding acceptable tool use.

Respect for This class is designed to prepare students for a professional work environment. Any disrespect toward a
Diversity fellow student during class will result in a loss of attendance credit for that class. Any gender discrimination,
racism or marginalization will result in the offending student being asked to leave the class meeting.

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students
bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. I intend to present materials and activities
that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and
culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the
effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In addition, if any of

our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make
arrangements for you.

Student Wellness As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained
relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of
motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance
and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and treatment does
work. You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus at: Counseling &
Psychological Services (CaPS) - Student Affairs - Carnegie Mellon University. Support is always available
