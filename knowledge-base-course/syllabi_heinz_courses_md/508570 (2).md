Additional Resources
Project Management Institute (pmi.org) has substantial project cost management content and materials
that you may like to reference during the course. While the scope of our courses focuses on project cost
management, there are many other resources available on this site that you may want to consider for
future projects.

Prerequisites/Required Software
Must have successfully taken 90-723 Financial Statements and Analysis or 95-719 Accounting and
Finance Analytics.

The course uses Microsoft Excel and Power BI for assignments and in class exercises. If you are not
comfortable with either software application, you can find courses through LinkedIn learning which you
have access to with your CMU account:
https://www.cmu.edu/web/training/linkedin-learning.html
For Power BI, as many students have not had exposure to Power BI, we will utilize this program in class
for workshops so understanding the basics of importing data, formatting data and adding visualizations
to your dashboard will be sufficient for the course.

You will only need Power BI Desktop for this course, we will not be using the Power BI service. It is a free
download here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494 Please note that if
you have a Mac you will need to use a remote desktop to utilize Power BI.

Course Description
This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of project cost management, data
analytics, and the application of Power BI tools for visualization. Through in-depth analysis, students will
learn how to identify potential cost overruns early in the project lifecycle. By analyzing real-world project
cases, students will build a comprehensive portfolio of skills tailored to address the challenges of cost
management and data-driven decision-making in project environments. Upon completion of this course,
students will be empowered to proactively identify, analyze, and mitigate cost overruns, driving project
success and delivering value to stakeholders.

Course Objectives
### At the end of this course, you should be able to:

-Analyze real-world examples of unsuccessful attempts to manage project cost overruns and apply the
lessons learned to future projects.
-Implement strategies to address cost overruns and deviations from the budget.
-Explore strategies for recovering from cost overruns and cost-cutting measures.
-Understand how capitalizing versus expensing project costs can affect the financial statements.
-Create interactive and dynamic project dashboards using Microsoft Excel and Power BI.

Course Organization
Canvas
The course will utilize Canvas for all material needed. All course deliverables are included in Canvas.

Class material is contained within the Modules tab in Canvas and organized by class session. Important
class information will be communicated via Canvas, including class being moved to a remote
environment, through announcements so please make sure to check frequently and have your
announcements turned on. (https://canvas.cmu.edu)
Reading Materials
This course is broken into 4 Modules. Each module will have reading assignments applicable to the
content for that module as well as articles or case studies on real projects that we will analyze during
class. You are expected to have read the material prior to class based on the schedule that is posted in
this syllabus.

Grading Summary
### Class Participation - 20%

## Discussion Boards - 20%

### Quizzes & Assignments - 25%

### Final Project - 35%

Your final grade depends on the extent to which you demonstrate the capacity to think critically about
project cost management that is demonstrated through in class discussions and application of cost
management concepts through the final presentation.

Any grading disputes must be communicated within 1 week of receiving the grade. After this point no
adjustments will be made.

Class Participation
Class participation will be an integral part of your learning experience in this course. Your participation
will be assessed during class and you will also self-assess your participation twice during the mini. This
includes demonstrating being prepared for class, participating and adding insights to class activities,
contributing to both small group discussions and larger group discussions.

Attendance will also contribute to your participation grade as you cannot be an active participant if you
are not in class. You may miss 2 classes for any reason (job interview, sickness, deadlines, etc) and you
have the option to notify me if you will miss, however it is not required.

Classroom Behavior
It is expected that you will arrive on time for class. Situations may infrequently occur where you may
need to arrive late, however please come in quietly to not disturb the lecture and your fellow
classmates. Laptops/ipads are allowed to be used during class, however you should not be working on

other classes or messaging with friends. No cell phone use is permitted during class sessions. It is very
apparent if this is occurring, and this will be reflected in your participation grade.
## Discussion Board

There will be a discussion board for each of the Modules during the course. Please note that there are
no extensions for discussion board participation. To earn full credit, you will need to post by the
deadlines. Please pay careful attention to the grading rubrics for the discussion forum.

Your insights from your prior experiences combined with the course material are valuable to the
discussion boards and the course content. You must make 1 original post in response to the discussion
prompt and 1 response to a classmate during each module.

Assignments & Quizzes
There will be individual assignments during the course which will be submitted in either Canvas or
through workshops via direct observation. Any questions related to the assignments should be
addressed during lecture or office hours so please do not wait until the last minute to look at the
assignment.

Your work is to be completed individually on the assignments, your answers should be in your own
words. This is defined as you should not have the exact same sentences as your classmates. You are
welcome to ask other students questions but completing the assignments together is not permitted.

Having possession of another students’ assignment in any form is considered an Academic Integrity
violation and will not be tolerated. Assignments will be checked for plagiarism using the Turnitin
application.

Further details of the specifics of the assignment submission guidelines are contained in each
assignment. Assignments turned in after the due date will be eligible for a maximum of 90% of the
original grade. You will have 24 hours past the due date to turn in the assignment for the reduced grade,
past that time frame no assignments will be accepted.

There will be 4 mini quizzes through the course for the purpose of comprehension checks of the contents
of each Module. The quiz can be completed at any point during the open window listed on Canvas. You
can use any course materials to complete the quiz. Late quizzes will not be accepted.

Final Project
This course will culminate with you presenting on a cost overrun project of your choice. You will need to
present the following on each project, the background of why the project was undertaken and then will
address topics from each of the modules in the course: resource planning, cost estimation, cost
budgeting and cost control. More information will be communicated during the course on the final
project.

Academic Integrity
All assignments that you are submitting should be in your own words, not classmates and not directly
taken from the books or online resources including financial statements. You may work with classmates
to discuss assignments and ask questions, but the assignments are to be completed individually. I will be
checking for plagiarism amongst assignments which includes having the same sentences as a classmate.

Cheating on assignments or exams will not be tolerated and will be communicated to Your Program
Director, The Associate Dean and The Dean of Student Affairs at the University. If you are caught
cheating, your final grade will be reduced by 2 letter grades.

You may use generative AI programs like ChatGPT during the class and/or assignments to help you
understand course content but not to generate answers (including paraphrasing) to assignment
problems. Generative AI programs rely on predictive models to generate content that may appear
correct, but has been shown to sometimes be incomplete, inaccurate, taken without attribution from
other sources, and / or biased. You are ultimately responsible for the content of the information you
submit. However, you may not attempt to pass off any work generated by an AI program as your own. It
is highly suggested to not use generative AI as a study tool as you will be provided with a significant
amount of information beyond the scope of the course.

Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, you need
to contact me to discuss your accommodations and requirements as early in the Mini as possible. I will
work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may
have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of
Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Diversity
We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable
and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves,
including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation,
gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these
diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students,
faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion
not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We
acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our
classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core
values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They
contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university.

Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on
the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the
incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:
Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: reportit.net username: tartans password: plaid
All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions.

Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus
climate to be more equitable and just.

Food Insecurity
If you are worried about affording food or feeling insecure about food, there are resources on campus
that can help. Email the CMU Food Pantry Coordinator to schedule an appointment:

### Student Academic Success Center

The Student Academic Success Center offers a wide variety of opportunities for students to deepen their
understanding of who they are as learner, communicator, and ultimately scholar. They support student
success by providing academic coaching, communication consulting and workshops, accommodations
