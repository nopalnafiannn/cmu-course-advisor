### HEINZ POLICY ON PLAGIARISM:

Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely serious matters. Misrepresentation of
another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant
when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or as cheating on an examination, including take- home as well as inclass examinations. The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the MEIM Program and Heinz School.
### Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

## 1. Plagiarism (explained below).

## 2. Submission of work that is not the student’s own.

## 3. Submission or use of falsified data.

## 4. Unauthorized access to an exam or assignment.

## 5. Use of a stand-in for an exam.

## 6. Use of unauthorized material in the preparation of an assignment or during an examination.

## 7. Supplying/communicating unauthorized information to another student for use in an assignment or exam.

## 8. Unauthorized collaboration on an assignment. Collaboration must be explicitly permitted by an instructor for it to be

considered authorized.
## 9. Submission of the same work for credit in more than one course.

Plagiarism is the failure to indicate the source of work either with quotation marks or footnotes. The source can be a
phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific language, or an idea derived from the work of another person. Note that
material on the web is another person’s work and is therefore equally subject to the rules on plagiarism and cheating as
any other source material.

Cheating and/or plagiarism on an essay assignment will result in a failing grade (0 points) for that assignment. The
essay in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the offending student’s assignments included in grade
calculations; the points for that essay zero (0) will be factored into the grade. Furthermore, the cheating student’s grade
shall be reduced one full letter grade. A cheating student’s final grade will be impacted significantly. In addition, cases
of cheating and plagiarism will be submitted to and reviewed by the Dean’s Office; more severe penalties may be imposed,
up to and including expulsion from the Heinz School.
### CLASS POLICY ON AI:

Any use of generative AI for any graded component of this course is explicitly prohibited. Using ChatGPT or other generative
AI to generate any course content will be considered an academic integrity violation.
