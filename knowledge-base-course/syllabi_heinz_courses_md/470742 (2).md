“It’s all in how you look at it.” --Sandy Murphy
In- Person, Live, Real, Attendance is crucial. That’s where the magic happens. Students on the
waitlist will only be considered if they have attended the first two classes.

Office hours
“It is the most unforgettable and interesting OH I ever attended” -- Past Student
I can be available for office hours on Monday and Wednesday before or after each class. For
office hours, I will be in Rm HBH 2011 from 2:00 – 3:20 and Rm HBH 2009 5:00 – 6:20 M/W. I
have found that my office hours tend to fill up as students begin to realize how helpful they can
be, so I have reserved rooms for before and after class. However, I will not always be in both so
please make an appointment. I will be in I strongly encourage all of my students to email me to
make an appointment to see me outside of class so that I can give you the personal time and
attention that you deserve. When requesting office hours, please include your section (i.e.,
B4/C4) and suggested agenda. If you are unable to make an appointment with me during my
office hours, I am happy to set up an appointment with you for another time via zoom. Really.

You will be glad you did. ☺
Course Overview
“I have realized I have much more potential than I give myself credit for.” – Past Student
Actors use “tools”. Chiefly- among them are voice, body, focus, intention, self-awareness) to
convey emotion and connect authentically with audiences. Acting for Leadership and
Communication will help you master the actor’s tools to become a more powerful presenter, to
feel more confident when communicating with others, to understand yourself and your audience
and to cultivate your own wisdom as a compassionate and effective leader. Through in-class
exercises, scene work and discussion, you will practice the art of self-reflection and the craft of
acting so you can learn how to enhance your abilities as a person, presenter and inspirational
leader.

Learning Outcomes
“I have changed like I never imagined. … And the spectacular thing is that I saw
the change in my classmates too.” – Past Student
### At the conclusion of this class, you should:

● Be able to define your strengths and your areas for continued work as a presenter, communicator
and leader
● Use the actor’s tools to enhance your interaction with others, your performances and
presentations
● Experience increased confidence in performing and presenting
● See an increase in your willingness to be spontaneous and take risks
● Be able to give honest supportive, encouraging and actionable feedback
● Be able to listen and respond authentically under given circumstances
“… As the weeks passed, I began to understand that this course was much more complex than
I could ever imagine.” – Past Student
Textbook
“I have learned trust, compassion, confidence, and finding comfort in the uncomfortable. All
these qualities and skills will help me be a better person, and definitely a better leader.” – Past
Student
There is no textbook for this class. You will need scripts from plays for your scene assignments.

You can find play scripts at Hunt Library (for free) or you can find them on-line from a variety
of sites.

If you are interested in learning more about the art of acting, there are many good books you can
read. Here are a few:
“On Acting”, Meisner, Sanford and Longwell, Dennis; Vintage Books, August 1987
“The Art of Acting”, Adler, Stella; Applause Theatre & Cinema Books, 2000
“An Actor Prepares”; Stanislavsky, Constantin, 1989 (reprint)
Class Policies
“The class builds trust, authenticity and support, and feels like an acting family.” -- Past
Student
Acting requires a willingness to play, to imagine and to stretch yourself. It can be
uncomfortable, which is why the classroom must be a place of support and encouragement for
everyone and from everyone.

Let’s embrace a willingness to take risks, to explore ourselves and to share the fun of acting.

Cell phones and computers will distract you and others from fully participating in the class.

Leave them off and away unless I ask you to use them in an exercise or for in-class feedback.

Cheating and Plagiarism
“The notion that trust is crucial for effective communication changed my approach to public
speaking in this class and far beyond.”—Past Student
It’s very hard to cheat or plagiarize in an acting class, but be clear that all your work must be
your own. Any written assignments must be yours and yours alone. If you use sources, cite
them. Violations of this policy will result in a minimum of failure for the assignment with the
potential of failure for the course.

Students may NOT us Generative AI in any form (not even grammerly or the like)
“I have learned how to be true to myself and being that way has made me a better
communicator with others.” – Past Student
I expect that all work and words students submit for this course will be their own. I have
carefully designed all assignments and class activities to support your learning. Doing your own
work, without human or artificial intelligence assistance, is best for your achievement of the
learning objectives in this course. In instances when collaborative work is assigned, I expect for
the submitted work to list all team members who participated. I specifically forbid the use of
ChatGPT or any other generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools at all stages of the work
process, including brainstorming. Deviations from these guidelines will be considered
violations of CMU’s academic integrity policy. Note that expectations for “plagiarism, cheating,
and acceptable assistance” on student work may vary across your courses and instructors. Please
ask me if you have questions regarding what is permissible and not for a particular course or
assignment.

Attendance and Participation
“I have to admit that I initially came with low expectations, thinking that I could use a “fun
course” to escape from the fatigue of the all the coding assignments and projects. However, I
ended up investing a lot of time and enjoying every moment of it. :D” – Past Student
This is an interactive class, with almost all of the work being done in class. You cannot learn if
you are not present. Nor can your scene partners learn because they will be relying on you to
give them what they need to respond to. Students who wish to earn an A in the class need to
attend all classes and participate wholeheartedly in all in-class exercises. Missing 2 classes will
result in the lowering of your final grade by one. If you miss more than 2 classes, you likely will
not pass this class. If you need miss a class for a scheduled interview, you will be required to
submit documentation of the appointment. If you miss class for health reasons, please submit a
report from a medical professional. An important part of participating in this class is providing
feedback to your peers and giving them your undivided attention during their performances.

Since feedback is the mechanism by which we can improve, you will provide feedback to your
classmates (and they to you) in a constructive and supportive manner. I will ask you to reflect on
your own performances so you can see where you have developed your skills and where you
might still need to develop them.

Wear comfortable clothing that you can move in. This class requires physical activity and your
clothing should allow you to work without inhibition.

Be on time. Entering the class late disrupts everyone’s concentration. We will begin promptly at
the class’s designated start time. Do not enter the classroom while another student is
performing. Wait until the performance is over and then you can enter.

Assignments
“Those little but crucial achievements from acting really gave me the energy to feel alive
and the courage to switch back to doing homework and job searching.” – Past Student
Your assignments will be performances, either alone or with a teammate. You must memorize
your lines for scene performances. But don’t worry if you happen to momentarily forget. We will
have someone “on-book” for you at all times. For performances, wear clothing appropriate to
the scene (a costume) and bring any necessary props. You can choose any scene that fits the
theme of the assignment. You do not need to adhere to age or gender in the script (e.g., a woman
can play Hamlet and a man can play Blanche DuBois) as long as it fits the intent of the scene.

Please be bold in your choices and choose scenes that are meaningful to you and with which you
can stretch yourself and have fun. I will post grades for your assignments in Canvas.

Grading
“I believe this will be invaluable in my professional life as I am more inclined to seize
unexpected opportunities now.” – Past Student
Course grades reflect your commitment and willingness to take risks, your preparation of
assignments and your mastery of the material we cover.

Your participation grade is based on the quantity and quality of your contribution to class
discussions, your commitment and willingness to undertake the in-class work, and your attention
and feedback to your classmates.

Participation and in-class exercises = 40 points
“Today, I step onto the stage with newfound confidence and ease.” – Past Student
Giving and receiving feedback is an important skill, which is not often mastered. Because it is
critical to your future success, we will give and receive feedback at almost every class to allow
you to practice this skill in class. You will receive points for providing feedback to your peers, as
follows: if you provide comprehensive, constructive, actionable feedback you will receive 1
point. If you provide no feedback or feedback that is vague, incomplete or cannot be acted on,
you will receive 0 points.

You will also receive points for the in-class exercises. There are four rubrics for in-class work,
each with a 2-point grading scale (you can find them at the end of this syllabus). We will use
one of these rubrics for each in-class exercise. You will receive feedback from your peers to help
you reflect on your performance. I will also provide you with feedback and ratings. My ratings
will determine the points you receive for that day’s work. The rubrics are focused on four topic
areas that are important to an actor’s work:
● Use of body and voice
### ● Focus and Listening

● Commitment and risk taking
● Spontaneity
You may be permitted to make up one in-class exercise in the case of an absence if, and only if,
subsequent class time permits. Any written assignments are due on the date stated. If your
assignment is turned in late, you will lose points. If you must miss class on the date of a prepared
scene, you should contact me to discuss options for completing the assignment. In general, I will
allow you to make up one prepared performance for documented severe illness or interviews
only. If you miss 2 classes, your grade will be lowered by one full grade. If you miss 3 classes,
you will not be able to pass the class.

Presentations/scenes – 4 at 10% each = 40 points
“Align my thoughts with my physical body.

This helps me lead my genuine life with ease, being more productive” -- Past Student
You will be rated on prepared scene work using a comprehensive rubric that includes the above
four elements plus one more focused on your level of preparation. (Included at the end of this
syllabus.) Your peers will provide feedback as will I. My ratings will determine the points you
receive for the assignment. As part of this preparation, you will conduct a written analysis of
your scene, due before your performance, and will receive 3 points for each analysis.

Final scene presentation = 20 points
“I let go and left my "safe zone" to find there is no such thing as a safe zone. Your safe zone
is the world when you are content with who you are and have accepted yourself entirely.”
– Past Student
Your final scene will be graded using the same rubric as for the prepared scene work above.

Your grade for the course will consist of your scores on the above elements converted to letter
grades using the following scale:
A+ 98% - 100% Superior
A 94% - 97.99% Outstanding
A- 90% - 93.99% Excellent
B+ 86% - 89.99% Very Good
B 82% - 85.99% Good
B- 78% - 81.99% Acceptable
C+ 74% - 77.99% Poor
C 70% - 73.99% Very Poor
C- 67% - 69.99% Lowest passing
### R Below 67% Failing

The grade you earn is the grade you will be assigned. Please do not ask me to increase your
final grade so you can improve your GPA or to give you the opportunity to do an extra
assignment to improve your final grade. I will not provide additional opportunities for grade
improvement.

Course Outline
“I have gone from a person who used to feel like the ‘Fake it till you make it’ to someone who
feels that I actually have ‘Made it’. This means that I feel more comfortable in my own skin,
satisfied with my own self and not afraid to show others what I have got.” -- Past Student

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:

If you have a disability and have an accommodation letter from the Disability
Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me
as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that
accommodations are provided as appropriate.

Take care of yourself
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This
will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support
during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus and
an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for
support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful. If you or anyone you know
experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological
Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at
http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family
member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.

Every individual must be treated with respect.

The ways we are diverse are many and are fundamental to building and maintaining
an equitable and an inclusive campus community. These include but are not limited
to: race, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity,
religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. We at CMU,
will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because it is necessary
for excellence and innovation, but because it is just. Therefore, while we are
imperfect, we all need to fully commit to work, both inside and outside of our
classrooms to increase our commitment to build and sustain a campus community that
embraces these core values. It is the responsibility of each of us to create a safer and
more inclusive environment. Incidents of bias or discrimination, whether intentional
or unintentional in their occurrence, contribute to creating an unwelcoming
environment for individuals and groups at the university. If you experience or observe
unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity, we encourage you to speak out for
justice and support in the moment and/or share your experience using the following
resources:
* Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150,
www.cmu.edu/student-diversity
Page 6of 6
* Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: www.reportit.net; username: tartans;
password: plaid.

All reports will be acknowledged, documented, and a determination will be made
regarding a course of action. All experiences shared will be used to transform the
campus climate to be more equitable and just.

Facial coverings.

CMU no longer requires you to wear facial coverings on campus. However, because
your success in this class is dependent on your health and the health of your partners, I
ask that you wear a mask if you suspect that there might be even the smallest chance
that you might be contagious. I will wear my mask to and from class in areas of high
congestion. When I am speaking in front of the class, I would like to remove my
mask, but I will only do that if I feel safe. I know this is a great inconvenience. I really
do not like wearing masks. I Very, very, very, very much do not like wearing masks.

But I will do it gladly if there is even a smallest chance that I may keep others safer.

Stopping the Spread of All Contagious Illnesses.

Stay home if you are symptomatic OF ANY VIRUS (flu, cold, etc) and contact University Health
Services(students)/healthcare provider (faculty & staff) and test. Community members should report
positive cases using this form. They will be given guidance on isolation and steps to take based on
your situation. IF YOU HAVE A NEGATIVE TEST, feel free to re-join class, but, please consider
wearing a mask until your symptoms abate.
