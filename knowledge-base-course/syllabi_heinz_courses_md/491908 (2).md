STRATEGIC PRESENTATION SKILLS (90-718)
This course equips students with essential skills to confidently navigate professional communication
scenarios, such as interviews, webinars, and face-to-face presentations. Activities include analyzing an
audience, crafting an outline, developing cohesive visuals, and speaking extemporaneously. By the end of
this course, students learn to adapt communication strategies to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders.

They will also possess the necessary tools to excel in a wide range of professional settings, contributing to
their overall academic and professional success.

USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TOOLS
Some assignments encourage the use of AI for content creation and delivery. However, it is imperative that
students verify the accuracy and credibility of the content, the references, and the evidence before sharing
their work. Conversely, some assignments prohibit the use of AI for content creation and delivery. In these
cases, students are required to demonstrate mastery of course objectives without AI assistance. This
ensures that students are well-equipped for their professional careers through impromptu interactions with
supervisors, co-workers, and clients.

USE OF VIRTUAL REALITY (VR)
Some homework assignments can be completed in Professor Hyatt’s VR lab using Ovation VR. While it is
optional to use VR for practice, combining VR training with feedback from in-person practice sessions has
proven to be an effective way to enhance public speaking skills.
# PROFESSIONALISM

As students embark on an exciting semester of professional growth at Heinz College, the importance of
professionalism must be addressed. In the world of academia, as in the professional world, adhering to
deadlines and maintaining high standards are indispensable qualities. Below are a few key reasons why
professionalism matter in this course:

## 1. Accountability: Meeting deadlines establishes accountability for your academic performance. It

reflects your dedication to the subject matter and showcases your ability to manage your time
effectively.
## 2. Quality of Work: Adhering to deadlines is conducive to producing high-quality assignments. Rushed

or late submissions often result in subpar work.
## 3. Respect for Others: Submitting work on time demonstrates respect for your peers who rely on

shared contributions for in-class workshops and activities. The act of sharing facilitates efficient and
effective completion of tasks for everyone involved.
## 4. Preparation for the Real World: Cultivating the habit of being punctual for class and submitting

work before deadlines sets the foundation for expectations you'll face in your future career. In a
professional context, tardiness for meetings or late submissions of work can result in missed
opportunities, dissatisfied clients, or even termination of your job.

This semester is an opportunity to develop and practice the essential skills of professionalism that will
serve you well throughout your academic journey and professional career. Remember that by consistently
meeting deadlines and maintaining high standards, you are setting yourself up for a future filled with
success and opportunities.

COURSE OBJECTIVES (according to Bloom’s revised taxonomy)
Students will be able to...

Remember: Identify effective presentation elements, including message effectiveness (e.g., strong
introduction, smooth transitions, logical flow, closure), verbal skills (e.g., pace, clarity,
filler words), and nonverbal skills (e.g., gestures, eye contact, posture).

Understand: Compare/contrast effective and ineffective presentations based on rubric elements.

Demonstrate an understanding of the key components that contribute to successful
presentations.

Apply: Adapt compelling messages to the perspectives of various stakeholders through written
and oral communications.

Utilize effective communication strategies in diverse professional contexts.

Analyze: Analyze recorded presentations, including impromptu speaking exercises, elevator
pitches, interviews, informative speeches, persuasive speeches.

Identify strengths and areas for improvement in both individual and peer presentations.

Evaluate: Provide constructive feedback to peers on their presentations.

Complete self-evaluations to reflect on personal communications and presentations.

Create: Produce effective presentations for a variety of professional contexts, considering the needs
and expectations of specific stakeholders.

NATIONAL COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION (NCA) COMPETENCIES
According to the NCA position on expectations for speaking and listening, “… skills must result in
effective outcomes and seen as appropriate (a) by the audience, (b) in the context enacted, and (c) for the
purpose specified.” See the link on Canvas for NCA Speaking and Listening Competencies for College
Students (Basic and Advanced Skills) that are covered in this course.
### ACCOMMODATIONS & OPTIONS FOR DIFFERENTIATION

If a student provides evidence of learning for a specific topic, demonstrating an advanced level of
proficiency (see rubric), a different assignment will be provided. Students are also provided options to
complete some assignments in correlation with their field of study or personal interest.

REQUIRED TECHNOLOGY (paid by CMU)
*  Record/analyze speeches using Zoom.
### *  Upload videos and write reflections using Acclaim, a flexible video platform that allows professors and

students to set up folders, embed videos, and share comments with each other.
# SEMESTER OVERVIEW

The semester is organized into the following areas with nonverbal, verbal, and visual communication aspects
integrated into our discussions and assignments:
### *  Building Professional Relationships (elevator pitch, interview, impromptu speaking exercises)

### *  Working in Teams (informative speech)

### *  Presenting to a Targeted Audience to Achieve a Specific Outcome (persuasive speech)

Students have access to course content via Canvas once registered. Specific assignments are not posted on
the syllabus.
# NO TEXT

Free online readings are provided via Canvas to target course objectives.
# ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY

If you plagiarize, you are in violation of academic integrity. An automatic “0” is assigned and the incident
gets reported to program administrators. Moreover, if you provide your work to another student and they use
it, you will also be reported for an academic integrity violation.

When it is not deemed appropriate by the professor, using AI is considered a violation of academic integrity.
### ATTENDANCE & PARTICIPATION POLICY

CMU Attendance Statement (adapted): To uphold a student’s right to confidentiality, to ensure equitable
treatment, and to protect a faculty member from adjudicating medical needs, the Provost and the Office of
General Counsel strongly encourage faculty to not ask for medical documentation to be provided directly to
them in the case of student absences or late arrivals. To remove ambiguity, some faculty have chosen an
attendance policy with no distinction between excused and unexcused. With this approach, instructors can
make clear that the reason for their attendance policy is to accurately reflect the amount of information
that the student engaged with during class.

Strategic Presentation Skills (SPS) is a workshop-based, interactive communication course with 10-12
students per section. It’s not a lecture-based course with exams. Due to this format, attendance and
participation are factored into your final grade.

SPS Attendance Policy: If you’re not present, you cannot engage with class activities. With daily group
interactions and impromptu speaking exercises, the class relies heavily on active participation for practice
sessions and feedback. Since there is no distinction between excused and unexcused, you do not need to
email the professor or the TA to provide a reason for an absence. If you’re unable to attend class, review the
weekly links on Canvas and meet with the TA. Furthermore, to protect a student’s right to privacy during
practice sessions and group work activities, classes are not recorded. Face-to-face learning is an expectation
at Heinz College.

SPS Participation Policy: As an interactive class, participation is an expectation (e.g., engaging with
speakers by asking questions, providing feedback after speeches, working productively with group
members). Therefore, you are expected to receive a 0 score. However, you may be awarded additional points
for extra effort, or you may receive negative points for a lack of effort. As a note, these points are completely
at the professor's discretion and based on direct observations during class.
### Bonus Participation Points:

*  If you go above and beyond to engage with speakers (e.g., asking questions, offering great feedback).
*  If you go above and beyond to engage with group members (e.g., taking a leadership role).
*  If you go above and beyond to practice speeches outside of class time (e.g., meetings with the TA or
practicing in the VR lab).
### Negative Participation Points:

*  If you are not prepared to give your speech on the assigned day, points are deducted.
*  If you're not an active listener (e.g., typing on your computer, checking emails or texts on your phone,
working on assignments for other classes, talking during someone's speech), points are deducted.
*  If you are not prepared when working with your group (e.g., vague outline, incomplete visuals),
points are deducted.
# GRADING POLICY

At the end of the semester, a final grade is calculated by combining the points for all assignments (minus
any deductions) and dividing that score by the total number of points [e.g., 329 (student’s score) / 350
(total points) = 94%]. There are no weighted assignments.

# LATE WORK POLICY

After a deadline, submit assignments to the “Late Work” folder on Canvas. Your work will not be
accepted via email since I utilize the commenting tools on Canvas to provide feedback. Since everyone
has an acceptable excuse for late work, I cannot give special consideration to some and not others
regarding the penalty for submitting a late assignment.

Since I am continuously grading weekly assignments (videos and reflections), I review late work at the
end of the semester, not when you submit the assignment. For major assignments, grading starts at 80%
of the total score. For reflections (only worth 10 points), I cannot accept late work. A reflection (e.g.,
reviewing a 30-second to 2-minute elevator pitch) only takes a few minutes to write. Therefore, it must be
completed during the week that it was assigned. Please do not submit reflections and expect them to be
graded after the deadline has passed. Reflections are posted to Acclaim, not Canvas; therefore, I do not
receive notifications on this platform for late submissions.

MISSING (ungraded) WORK
A draft, ungraded work, is an important part of the learning process. If a quality draft is not submitted,
-10 points are deducted from your participation score. Without a quality draft, you cannot fully participate
with in-class activities for group work, and there is a penalty for not completing your homework. Drafts
are utilized to provide feedback to a student prior to submitting the work for a grade.
# OFFICE HOURS

Office hours start at 8:00 AM on class days. Late afternoon, evening, and weekend appointments are also
available to accommodate a variety of schedules. Please feel free to stop in or email me to schedule a
meeting.
### PLACEMENT & EXEMPTION POLICY

To apply for an exemption, students must meet the criteria (see the Heinz website for specific directions
and exemption exam dates).
### REGISTRATION & WAITLIST POLICY

A maximum of twelve students are registered for each SPS section. Once a section is full, admission to
the course is dependent on (1) the number of registered students who drop the section, and (2) the waitlist
order.
# DIVERSITY STATEMENT

Diversity (adapted from https://www.cmu.edu/student-diversity): Diversity and inclusion have a
singular place among the values of Carnegie Mellon University. This class will “enhance an inclusive and
transformative student experience in dimensions such as access, success, and intergroup dialogue”
through class activities, writing workshops, discussions, and assignments.
# WELLNESS STATEMENT

Wellness (adapted): Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by
eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking time to relax. This
will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. There are many resources available on campus, and
an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. You are not alone.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings of anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is
available to help you. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty, or family member for help. If you or
someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night.
