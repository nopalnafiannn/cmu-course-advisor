# 94-803: Consulting Lab

## Course Information

**Units:** 6

## Description

Communication is the glue that holds consulting engagements, teams, and relationships together. Arguably, the better a consultant you are, the better a communicator you are, and the best communicators tend to make very good consultants (nice symmetry there). Poor communication and other 'soft skills' can derail a consulting engagement and with it, a promising consulting career. As an example, a Gartner Group study found that 80% of all IT projects were late, over budget, or failed completely because of poor communication at the outset. This course will help students interested in a consulting career acquire new skills in everything from personal branding to asking high-value, incisive questions to building strong, long-term client relationships
