Description This course will be an analysis of the entertainment industry, specifically looking through the lens of the film
business, how it is evolving, and how streaming is changing the landscape of both the film and theatre
businesses. The class will highlight talent representation (key agencies, agents, and a brief discussion about
their interaction with managers, lawyers, etc.), packaging, and the modern studio system. The class is an
immersion in the language and dynamics of the industry through the eyes of an insider with the goal of

### Course ABSENCES/ TARDY:

Policies & If you know you are going to be late or have to miss a class, please contact me prior to class via email or leave
Expectations a message for me at the MEIM Center.
### PARTICIPATION:

Class participation, which includes your General Attitude, Communication Skills, Organizational Skills and
Creativity and Innovativeness, is weighted heavily in this class because in the real world there are many group
dynamics and meetings that will require your input in the room – as a writer, producer, agent or executive.

The industry is a collaborative medium and in order to be successful you will need to have the ability to think
on your feet, present your ideas articulately and succinctly, and contribute to group brainstorming sessions.

You will also need to give and receive critiques with diplomacy and grace. My assessment of you will reflect
all of these aspects of participation in addition to professional presentation, enthusiasm, improvement
throughout the course and punctuality.

Plagiarism Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely serious matters.
and cheating Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious violation.
notice* The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or as cheating on an
examination, including take-home as well as in class examinations.

The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the MEIM Program and Heinz School.
### Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

## 1. Plagiarism (explained below);

## 2. Submission of work that is not the student’s own;

## 3. Submission or use of falsified data;

## 4. Unauthorized access to an exam or assignment;

## 5. Use of a stand-in for an exam;

6.Use of unauthorized material in the preparation of an assignment or during an examination;
7.Supplying or communicating unauthorized information to another student for use in an assignment or exam
8.Unauthorized collaboration on an assignment. Collaboration must be explicitly permitted by an instructor
for it to be considered authorized.
## 9. Submission of the same work for credit in more than one course.

Plagiarism is the failure to indicate the source of work either with quotation marks or footnotes. The source
can be a phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific language, or an idea derived from the work of another
person. Note that material on the web is another person’s work and is therefore equally subject to the rules
on plagiarism and cheating as any other source material.

Cheating and/or plagiarism on an essay assignment will result in a failing grade (0 points) for that
assignment. The essay in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the offending
student’s assignments included in grade calculations; the points for that essay zero (0) will be factored
into the grade. Furthermore, the cheating student’s final grade will be reduced one full letter grade.

A cheating student’s final grade will be impacted significantly. In addition, cases of cheating and plagiarism
will be submitted to and reviewed by the Dean’s Office; more severe penalties may be imposed, up to and
including expulsion from the Heinz School.

Academic Dishonesty: Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards inside and outside the
classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e. plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration) is obviously
discouraged and will be treated appropriately. The usual penalty for violations is a failing grade for the
particular assignment in question; however, in some instances, such actions may result in a failing grade for
the course.

Artificial In this class, you are welcome to use generative AI programs such as ChatGPT or DALL-E.
### Intelligence Suggested uses include:

Policy *  Brainstorm new ideas.
*  Develop example outlines or approaches to your work.
*  Research topics, or generate different ways to talk about a problem.
### You may not use AI to:

### *  Generate content that you cut and paste into an assignment with a written component without

quotations and a citation.
*  Generate content that is not adequately paraphrased without a citation.
*  Generate bibliographies for topics that you haven’t researched yourself.
### *  Generate other content (images, video, others) unless expressly permitted and following provided

guidance.
### *  Otherwise use or present generative AI content that you pass off as your own work, when really it is

not.
### If you use AI:

*  You must acknowledge the use of AI tools within your work.
### *  You should recognize that large language models often provide incorrect information, fake citations,

contradictory statements or incorporate plagiarized materials.
