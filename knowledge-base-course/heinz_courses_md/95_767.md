# 95-767: Cybersecurity for Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

## Course Information

**Units:** 6

## Description

Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have allowed for a surge in adoption of AI & ML solutions to address problems across numerous domains. With this rising reliance on AI & ML in many organizations, it is critical that such systems are protected from malicious activities. This course will discuss AI & ML cybersecurity issues, explore case studies of AI & ML cyber incidents, present AI & ML adversarial techniques, and demonstrate secure design approaches to protect AI & ML systems. With an emphasis on machine learning, the course will focus on secure machine learning systems development approaches and secure machine learning operations (MLOps). Students are expected to have knowledge of fundamental statistics and the ability to program in Python.
