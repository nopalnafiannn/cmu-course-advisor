Important Note
I want to do everything I can to support you. To do this, though, I need to know about a problem
when it starts, not after it has already derailed your ability to keep up with the class. Letting me
know sooner rather than later is key. I am in a better position to help you and find resources to
assist if you tell me when the problem arises. It is much harder, and in some cases, impossible
to do this if you wait until the end of the term. To do so, you can email me or come to office
hours.

The upshot is that I am here to help and care. If you are having life issues that are making it
hard for you to keep up with the class, please let me know.

Course Description
The 2020 election was the culmination of years of intensified debates and legal battles over voting
rights, election procedures, and regulations. These events highlighted uncomfortable questions about
the state and nature of U.S. elections and amplified them to a new level. Are U.S. elections fair? Who
can run for office? Do all Americans have access to their right to vote? Are elections subject to
external interference? Furthermore, is the system broken, and if so, how can we fix it? This class will
consider these questions and more as we work to explore U.S. elections. We will take the U.S.

Constitution and federal and state laws as a baseline and consider the legal and societal factors that
influence the workings of the U.S. electoral system. This course will touch on topics such as voting
laws, campaign finance, disinformation, and democratic erosion. Through this process, we will
confront the challenges facing the U.S. electoral system and explore pathways forward for the future
of democracy in the United States.

Learning Objectives
### At the conclusion of this course, students should be able to:

## 1. Summarize and describe current public policy challenges related to elections in US Politics

## 2. Present policy solutions and recommend solutions to relevant stakeholders.

## 3. Effectively communicate perspectives on the elections and politics in writing.

## 4. Plan, organize, and deliver coordinated work targeted at a goal.

## 5. Identify changes in voting rights and enfranchisement throughout history

## 6. Analyze and apply evidence to build arguments

## 7. Apply redistricting tools to create electoral districts and analyze the impact of the redistricting

process.

Engagement Activity
● Canvas and Syllabus Quiz: Students will complete a brief online assessment to ensure
comprehension of course details outlined in the syllabus. The quiz is posted on Canvas. The
quiz is open book and notes but cannot be completed with other students’ assistance. All
answers for the quiz are provided either on Canvas or in the syllabus. This assignment must
be completed by 11:59 pm on Wednesday, September 4th.
● Reading Notes and Discussion Leading: Students will write notes and present on the
course readings for one class during the term. Your job will be to summarize the readings in a
short document posted on Canvas by 11:59 pm the night before your presentation for your
classmates and then provide a brief 5-minute presentation of the readings at the beginning of
class. Specific guidelines will be provided on Canvas.

In-class presentations should not copy the content provided in your reading notes. You should
assume your colleagues have completed all the appropriate readings and read your notes
before class. Instead, you should focus on themes that tie the readings together and questions
or thoughts you had that will provide a foundation to start our class discussion.
● Policy Memo: Students will write a policy memo (1) identifying a concern with current election
administration in the United States other than gerrymandering and redistricting and (2)
outlining a recommended policy intervention. Additional information and requirements for this
project will be posted on Canvas by September 24th at 11:59 pm, and the project will be due on
October 9th at 11:59 pm. The goal of this assignment is to build your skills in identifying and
summarizing a problem, presenting potential solutions, and recommending a solution to
others. Please write your paper with changes tracked in Google Docs.
● Redistricting Presentation: In groups of 3-4 students, you will work to redistrict a state of
your choosing with at least 10 congressional districts. As a group, you will need to (1) identify
the current electoral districts and redistricting policy in your chosen state, (2) determine a
specific goal for your redistricting process (partisan balance, increased minority representation,
etc.), (3) use available software to create new district boundaries that align with these goals,
(4) compare and contrast your districts with current districts, (5) outline how your new districts
affect representation, and (6) identify any lessons learned. Your redistricting process can be as
complicated as using available data and algorithms to create your districts or as simple as
hand-selecting your districts in a program like District Builder.

Prepare a 15- to 20-minute class presentation on this process using either a PowerPoint or
class handouts on your redistricting process. Slides or class handouts should be submitted 48
hours before your presentation date. The instructor will review the presentation materials to
ensure that they are effective. Additional guidelines will be provided on Canvas.
● Extra Credit – Civic Engagement Assignment ( + 3% to your grade) First-hand experience
and civic engagement provide an insight into American politics that I can never replicate in a
course setting or simulation. That said, I am cognizant of various barriers that would make a
formal assignment requiring participation unfair. To encourage such participation, I’m offering
up to 3 percent extra credit not to exceed a final course grade of more than 100% for any
student that:
(1) Participates in volunteer work or interacts with a non-profit, government agency, grassroots
organization, or election. These activities include but are not limited to going to a local
government town hall, volunteering as a poll worker, attending a campaign event, watching
a congressional hearing online, or even watching past campaign rallies on YouTube. To
complete this activity, you do not need to participate in a partisan or governmentsponsored event. Just make sure you can find some link between the activity and
elections. If an online option is chosen, the engagement must be equivalent to the time it
would take to attend a meeting in person (at least 1 hour in length).
# AND

(2) Writes a 500-word (approximately 1 page double spaced) reflection on your experience,
tying what you learned to a concept studied in our class. Details for this assignment will be
on Canvas, including formatting expectations. This paper must be completed and submitted
by 11:59 pm on the Saturday after the final day of class (October 12th).

Course Policies
● Make-up and Late work policy: Due dates for every assignment are provided in the course
syllabus and posted on Canvas. Unless otherwise stated, assignments are due on those days.

However, I recognize that sometimes “life happens.” In these instances, you are allotted one
flex day for use during the semester. This day allows you to submit one assignment one day
late without penalty. You can use this day for any reason. You do not need to provide me with
the explanation: simply email me and tell me you would like to use your flex day and include
this information at the top of your submitted assignment. Flex dates cannot be used for
group assignments or presentations as these assignments are tied to specific dates in the
class schedule.

Once you’ve exhausted your flex day, point deductions will occur for any assignment submitted
after the deadline. A late assignment submitted within 24 hours of the due date will only be
eligible for 80% of the maximum points allotted. From 24-48 hours after the deadline,
assignments will be eligible for 60% of the maximum points allotted. Assignments submitted
more than 48 hours after the due date (+ any flex dates) will not be accepted. Please let me
know if you experience extenuating circumstances (e.g., you are hospitalized) that prohibit you
from submitting your assignments on time. I will evaluate these instances on a case-by-case
basis and may require documentation.

For extenuating circumstances, you must contact me before the deadline for the project
passes.
● Attendance and participation policy: Attendance for this course is mandatory. Course
Discussions ensure that you learn not just from your instructor but also from your peers. Each
student who stays home from class or does not contribute is a lost perspective and a
counterpoint that could have been raised. Attendance means more than physical proximity in
the classroom. You should make at least one meaningful contribution to a small group
discussion, activity, or class discussion in each class.

Please come to class prepared, having read, viewed, or listened to the assigned materials.
### Quality comments in a course discussion include at least one of the following characteristics:

o Builds on another comment
o Contributes toward moving the discussion or analysis forward
o Offers a different and unique perspective that is relevant to the discussion
o Demonstrates reflective thinking that includes some evidence, argumentation, or
recognition of inherent tradeoffs.
### Students who do not attend class will have their final course grades reduced as follows:

o 2 unexcused absences: One-point reduction in grade (i.e., from A to B)
o 3-4 unexcused absences: Two-point reduction in grade (i.e., from A to C)
o 5+ unexcused absences: Students will fail the course
That said, please do not come to class sick. If you are ill or have been exposed to COVID-19
and are worried about attending class, I ask that you first email me. If you feel well enough to
participate in class, I will make every effort to include you in class via a virtual method, like
Zoom. If you cannot attend a class session due to sickness or a school-sanctioned event,
please email me at least 2 hours before the missed class to ensure it is an excused absence.
● Email policy: Email is the best way to contact me outside class. My email address is listed at
the top of this syllabus. I will do my best to respond to weekday emails within 24 hours.

Messages received after 6 pm will be answered the next day, and emails received on
weekends will be answered by the following Monday. Many students send emails with
questions near assignment due dates. I can only guarantee that your questions will be
answered if you email at least one workday before deadlines.
● Re-grade policy: I will strive to assign grades that fairly and accurately reflect the quality of
the work you submit. I will only re-grade assignments if the change has the potential to affect
your final grade. Any requests for re-grades must be submitted to me in writing within one
week of receiving your graded work back, and you must explain in writing why you feel your
grade was inappropriate. Regrades can result in raising or lowering your initial grade.
● Recording Classes: No student may record classroom activity without my written consent.

We discuss sensitive topics in class, and each student should feel comfortable contributing.

That said, if you have (or think you may have) a disability such that you need to record or tape
classroom activities, please contact the Office of Disability Resources to request an
appropriate accommodation.
● Academic Integrity & Collaboration: Honesty and transparency are important features of
good scholarship. Conversely, plagiarism and cheating are serious academic offenses with
serious consequences. If you are discovered engaging in either behavior in this course, you
will earn a failing grade on the assignment in question, and further disciplinary action will be
taken. For a clear description of what counts as plagiarism, cheating, and/or the use of
unauthorized sources and tools, please see the University’s Policy on Academic Integrity
(revised in April 2013): https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academicintegrity.html
I encourage you to use campus resources like the Student Academic Success Center
(SASC) to assist you in your pursuit of academic excellence. However, please note that in
accordance with the university’s policy, you must acknowledge any collaboration or assistance
that you receive on work that is to be graded, either from a person, reference, or a tool
(including tools like Grammarly). So, when you turn in any assignments, please include a
sentence at the end that says either:
“I worked alone on this assignment.”, or
“I worked with __________ [person or tool] on this assignment.” and/or
“I received assistance from _________ [person or tool] on this assignment.”
Providing this information will not impact your grade and will only serve to help me understand
you better.

If you have questions about my integration of the university’s policy into this course, please do
not hesitate to ask. I aim to foster an environment where you can learn and grow while
ensuring that the work we all do is honest and fair. For more information about Carnegie
Mellon’s standards concerning academic integrity, you can also check out the following
link: http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/
● Use of Artificial Intelligence/Chat GPT: Assignments in this course are designed to improve
your communication skills and ability to apply class concepts in your arguments. I also hope
written assignments from this class can be used as writing samples for job applications. To
best support your learning and future career development, you may not use generative AI tools
to build the arguments in your paper or write any component of your project, including
brainstorming topics. These activities are essential for developing the fundamental skills and
expertise represented by the learning objectives of this course. Generative AI tools rely on
probabilistic models to generate content, which may sometimes be incomplete, inaccurate,
unoriginal, or biased. I have even seen AI plagiarizing content without a student’s knowledge.

An AI tool should not be considered a substitute for traditional approaches to research.

You are ultimately responsible for the content of the information you submit and may not
attempt to pass off work generated by an AI program as your own. All written submissions
must be submitted with changes tracked.

Passing off any AI-generated content as your own (e.g., cutting and pasting content into
written assignments, paraphrasing AI content, or using AI to brainstorm your paper
topic) constitutes a violation of CMU’s academic integrity policy.1
However, there is one major exception. Generative AI is a powerful tool for gaining feedback
on the quality of your paper and identifying strengths and weaknesses before submitting final
drafts. In this spirit, you may use generative AI tools to obtain feedback on the strengths and
weaknesses of your paper. This feedback can help you identify areas for improvement in your
writing. As an important line, this process will be considered academic dishonesty if generative
AI changes your paper’s text or re-writes your thesis, argument, or examples. You must
implement any recommendations made on your own. An example of an appropriate prompt is
provided here.2 If you choose to use generative AI in this spirit, you must cite the generative AI
platform used and submit a log of prompts you use when interacting with generative AI.

If you have any questions about using generative AI in this course, please email or talk to me.
● Accommodations for students with disabilities: If you have a disability and require
accommodations, please contact Catherine Getchell, Director of Disability Resources, at 412268-6121, getchell@cmu.edu. If you have an accommodations letter from the Disability
Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as
early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are
provided as appropriate.
● Statement on student wellness: As a student, you may experience a range of challenges
that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance
use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating, and/or lack of motivation. These mental health
concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your
ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and treatment does work.

You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus
1 For the purposes of this policy, I do not consider the basic functions of Grammarly including language and grammar
edits as Generative AI. However, Grammarly has an AI component that generates text as you write. This latter option is
considered use of Generative AI and is not allowed.
2 This link is for OpenAI’s ChatGPT which is not approved software by the university. The same prompt can be copied and
used with Microsoft Copilot. You can access Microsoft Copilot through your university login.
at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and
Psychological Services: 412-268-2922.

A more detailed statement on support systems is included at the end of this syllabus. It
provides a list of resources beyond Counseling and Psychological Services to help you
succeed in your academic journey. Please use these resources at your discretion and feel free
to share them with other members of the CMU community where relevant.
● Diversity Statement: We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many
ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive
campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including
but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation,
gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of
these diverse identities, and many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our
students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We at CMU will work to promote diversity,
equity, and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation but because
we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the
work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community
that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer,
more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination occur, whether intentional or unintentional.

They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the
university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or
hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support within the moment
of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the
following resources:
Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a report by
calling 844-587-0793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com.

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following
actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform
our campus climate to be more equitable and just.
● Devices Policy: I have a strong preference for no technology in the classroom. Research
shows that students who write notes retain more information from courses than those who do
so via typing. (Article) Moreover, frequent focus on a computer screen can be disruptive. As a
discussion-focused course, computer screens can also create a distance in discussions and
impede full participation. If you must use an electronic device for this purpose, you may do so
under the condition that you use it responsibly and only to take notes. Please do not engage
in emailing, cell phone use, texting, tweeting, social media messaging, or web browsing
in class. If there is an emergency and you must send a message, please step out of the
classroom.
● Land Acknowledgement: The land on which we are learning, working, and growing is part of
the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the Osage. We pay respect to the Osage people
past, present, and future.

### Description and Breakdown of Readings:

All readings are required unless otherwise noted. All readings are linked in this document
and/or provided through the course Canvas site in Modules. (Links may require sign-in with
your CMU ID.)
Comment on Readings: I believe in incorporating a wide array of people and perspectives in
this class. This commitment means making sure that we cover the work of scholars from diverse
backgrounds. This integration of diverse perspectives is often less explicit as we use examples
from a variety of people and places to illustrate arguments and motivate thought. I’ve worked on
this balance through discussions with colleagues. I won’t be perfect, but I will continue to work
on making this class a place where everyone can find something new to become fascinated and
challenged by the elections and public policy. Please come talk to me with positive and negative
feedback as well as readings of interest. My office door, email inbox, and ears are always open.

I appreciate when students provide feedback, and I promise a safe space free from retaliation
for these conversations.

### Get to Know You Survey

5 I recognize that not all students in this course have grown up around American politics. While I will provide background
that is necessary to understand elections in the United States, there are some topics that I do not have time to cover. If
you would like more information on the basics of the US government, I have provided a list of resources on Canvas under
the heading “Introduction to American Politics”.

Topic I: How Do US Elections Work (Class 2-3: August 29th- September 3rd)
These classes are designed to provide a foundational understanding of the structure of US elections
and their evolution over time. We will begin by exploring different electoral systems and the unique
characteristics of the US electoral process before covering the democratization of elections and key
milestones and elections that expanded voting rights. While completing these readings, consider (1)
how elections in the US work, (2) how the specific voting systems chosen both increase and
decrease representation, and (3) how representation in US elections has changed over time.

Topic II: Voting Laws and Voter Accessibility (Class 4-7: September 5th - September 17th)
What laws govern voting in the US, and how do these structure access to our electoral system?

Furthermore, is there a tradeoff between electoral legitimacy and security? This part of the course
starts by examining the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and the significant impact of the Shelby County v.

Holder decision. The remainder of this section considers the structure of US elections in the aftermath
of this decision. We will consider who is eligible to vote and the administrative mechanisms facilitating
and hindering access to elections. At the end of this exploration, we’ll consider claims of voter fraud
and electoral security. We will also explore definitions of electoral integrity and how they shape our

understanding of US elections. As you are reading, consider the following questions: (1) Who has
access to vote in the US, (2) What are the positives and negatives of implementing voting laws, (3)
what is electoral integrity, (4) how would you design an election in the US, and (5) What are the main
threats to electoral integrity in the United States, and how can they be addressed?

Topic III: Representation and Redistricting (Class 8-9: September 19th- September 24th)
Representation is at the heart of a functioning democracy. This section explores how states choose to
construct electoral districts and the challenges and controversies surrounding this process. In these
courses, we will outline the redistricting process, gerrymandering, and the impact of these procedures
on representation. Furthermore, we’ll explore the role of algorithms in this process and the tensions
we face between technological solutions to gerrymandering and the potential for technology to
exacerbate partisan gerrymandering. Throughout these courses, consider the following questions: (1)
How do we define fair representation, and (2) does our current electoral system match these
conceptions, (3) How can technology both help and hinder this process, and (4) who is most
impacted by the effects of gerrymandering? These courses are also designed to provide basic
information on redistricting tools for your Redistricting presentations.

Topic IV: Campaigns and Candidates (+ Presentations) (Class 10-13: September 26th- October
8th)
Now that we’ve covered how elections in the US are structured, this section turns the focus to political
candidates and campaigning. We’ll consider how individuals choose to run in the system that we’ve
spent several weeks studying and examine how they structure their campaign messaging, given
some of the representation challenges we’ve covered. Furthermore, we’ll consider the influence of
campaign finance laws and donor access. During this section, consider the following questions: (1)
What factors motivate individuals to run for office in the U.S., (2) how do these motivations vary by
gender, race, and socio-economic status, (3) How do candidates craft their campaign messages, (4)
do voter and candidate demographics affect messaging, (5) how do campaign finance laws affect the
electoral environment, (6) are there any policy interventions that address some of these concerns?
