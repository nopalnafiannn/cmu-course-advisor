industry and discuss passion vs profession or is it possible to have both.

Class 3: What Is In An Idea AND Consumer Consumption: Streaming Business
Strategies – The problem with Twitter and Quibi
Topic Perhaps no other innovation has shaken the entertainment and media industries in
the past 50 years more than the advent of the Internet and bandwidth speeds that
enable the consumption of content digitally. In this session, we will look at
creating an entertainment event from an idea, what are the wins and the
unforeseeable pitfalls. Also, the class will discuss consumer consumption of
content, during the pandemic with Quibi, its business model and strategies, etc., in
such a short period of time; especially when it was helmed by experienced,
Fortune 500 CEOs with capital that most entrepreneurs wish they had.

We will also look at the recent acquisition of X formerly Twitter by Elon Musk
and discuss its current status and how it is drastically affecting Tesla.

### Class 5 & 6: Student Final Presentations

Final The final class will include a simulation of a real-world business
Presentation development environment where students will demonstrate the
concepts and skills they have learned and acquired in class.

Each student will identify a business development opportunity, for
any aspect in the entertainment and media industry, and create a
proposal to address it. Within the classroom setting, each student will
have a total of 8 minutes to present a business plan as if they are the
person responsible for the proposal - or selling the proposal - to the
rest of the class, including a panel of students who will act as judges
(or, as the case may be, “funders,” “investors” or “approvers”). The
judges will have 2 minutes to ask questions and follow-up with the
presenter. Students are encouraged to participate in a rotation as a
judge to earn their participation grades for the session.
● Your presentation must include a review of the business
opportunity, and your proposal to address it, in PowerPoint
(no more than 5 slides, not including cover and agenda)
o Outline the opportunity, with details such as market size
and growth rate
o Explain why you believe the opportunity is important,
including its alignment with the company’s strategy and
implications for future opportunities.
o Propose a strategy for addressing the opportunity
o Describe which corporate functions are necessary for
planning
o Identify how much money you need to accomplish the
goal
o Describe the potential or likely return on investment (or
other ancillary benefits) -Seems important
o Include a timeline/schedule for key events and
milestones
o The presentation does not have to be tied to assignments
1 or assignment 2.
### *  In addition to presenting your proposal in class, your

PowerPoint presentation must be sent to Michele Smith and
Mary Ryan by Monday, February 10, two days before the
5th class along with a 1-paragraph summary that includes a
title and the student’s name.

Plagiarism and Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely serious
cheating notice* matters. Misrepresentation
of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious violations.

The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or as
cheating on an examination, including take‐home as well as in
class examinations. The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the MEIM
Program and Heinz College.
### Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

### *  Plagiarism (explained below)

### *  Submission of work that is not the student’s own

### *  Submission or use of falsified data

### *  Unauthorized access to an exam or assignment

### *  Use of a stand‐in for an exam

### *  Use of unauthorized material in the preparation of an assignment or during an

examination
### *  Supplying or communicating unauthorized information to another student for use in

an assignment or exam
*  Unauthorized collaboration on an assignment. Collaboration must be explicitly per
mitted by an instructor for it to be considered authorized.
### *  Submission of the same work for credit in more than one course

Plagiarism is the failure to indicate the source of work either with quotation marks or
Footnotes including
AI. The source can be a phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific language, or an idea
derived from the work of another person. Note that material on the web is another person’s
work and is thereforeequally subject to the rules on plagiarism and cheating as any other source
material.

Cheating and/or plagiarism on an assignment will result in a failing grade (0 points) for that assi
gnment.
### *  The assignment in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the offending

student’s assignments included in grade calculations.
*  The points for that essay zero (0) will be factored into the grade.
*  The cheating student’s final grade will be reduced one full letter grade.
*  A cheating student’s final grade will be impacted significantly.
### *  Cases of cheating and plagiarism will be submitted to and reviewed by the Dean’s Offi

ce; more severe penalties may be imposed, up to and
including expulsion from Heinz College.

Academic Dishonesty: Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards inside
and outside the classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e. plagiarism and
unauthorized collaboration) is obviously discouraged and will be treated appropriately. The
usual penalty for violations is a failing grade for the assignment in question; however, in some
instances, such actions may result in a failing grade for the course.
