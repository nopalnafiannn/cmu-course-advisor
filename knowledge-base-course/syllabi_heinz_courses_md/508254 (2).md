Final assignment (branded content plan)

Plagiarism Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely serious matters.
and cheating Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious violations.
notice* The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or as cheating on an
examination, including take-home as well as in-class examinations.

The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the MEIM Program and Heinz School.
### Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

## 1. Plagiarism (explained below);

## 2. Submission of work that is not the student’s own;

## 3. Submission or use of falsified data;

## 4. Unauthorized access to an exam or assignment;

## 5. Use of a stand-in for an exam;

6.Use of unauthorized material in the preparation of an assignment or during an examination;
7.Supplying or communicating unauthorized information to another student for use in an assignment or exam;
8.Unauthorized collaboration on an assignment. Collaboration must be explicitly permitted by an instructor for it
to be considered authorized.
## 9. Submission of the same work for credit in more than one course.

Plagiarism is the failure to indicate the source of work either with quotation marks or footnotes. The source can
be a phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific language, or an idea derived from the work of another person.

Note that material on the web is another person’s work and is therefore equally subject to the rules on plagiarism
and cheating as any other source material.

Cheating and/or plagiarism on an essay assignment will result in a failing grade (0 points) for that
assignment. The essay in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the offending student’s
assignments included in grade calculations; the points for that essay zero (0) will be factored
into the grade.

Furthermore, the cheating student’s final grade will be reduced one full letter grade. A cheating student’s final
grade will be impacted significantly. In addition, cases of cheating and plagiarism will be submitted to and
reviewed by the Dean’s Office; more severe penalties may be imposed, up to and including expulsion from the
Heinz School.

Academic Dishonesty: Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards inside and outside the
classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e. plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration) is obviously
discouraged and will be treated appropriately. The usual penalty for violations is a failing grade for the particular
assignment in question; however, in some instances, such actions may result in a failing grade for the course.

Artificial Any use of generative AI for any graded component of this course is explicitly prohibited. Using ChatGPT or
Intelligence other generative AI to generate any course content will be considered an academic integrity violation.
