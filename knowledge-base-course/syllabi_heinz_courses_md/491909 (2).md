Course Description
● In this course students will be introduced to Affordable Housing Policy and Finance in the U.S. Context.

Approximately half of each class session will be spent describing local, state, and federal housing policies
and discussing the implications (both positive and negative) of these policies in urban settings. The
students will read two books to be used as aids for class discussion. The books are The Color of Law by
Richard Rothstein and Evicted by Matthew Desmond. Additionally, there may be one or two occasions
where a guest speaker presents a specific policy issue.
● The remaining half of each class session will be spent learning the financial computations used by
practitioners of housing development. In other words, how are new affordable housing developments
financed when the developer knows that the rents will be less than what he/she could receive on the private
market? The course will cover the basic principles of both market-rate and affordable housing finance. The
instructor will also teach the fundamentals of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. By the end of the course,
the students will be expected to know how to calculate Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and use them to
generate equity in affordable housing developments.
● The course is for students who may want to work for local, state, and/or the federal government directly impacting
issues related to affordable housing. This course is also for students who would like to work for an affordable
housing developer, a real estate practitioner, and/or is just interested in the topic of affordable housing.
● There are no prerequisites for the course.

Learning Objectives
● Learning Objectives include:
● Obtain an understanding of past and current U.S. Federal Policy related to affordable housing;
specifically, as it relates to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). How does the
movement in HUD’s annual budget affect affordable housing programs across the county?
● Understand the fundamentals of the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program and
how it is used as a funding mechanism to create affordable housing.
● Be able to draft affordable housing budgets and cash flow analyses using various funding sources.
● Using Pittsburgh as an example, understand how cities across the country are addressing the issue
of a shortage of affordable units.
● Learn about the historic role that public and private lenders have played in the housing market.
● Study issues of poverty and racism and how poverty and racism affect housing choice by reading
two policy-related books.

amount of Low-Income Housing Tax Credits needed to construct sample housing developments. The
student will also need to calculate the equity and other funding sources.
● Paper Related to a Policy Issue Described in Evicted: The student is expected to choose one of three
instructor proposed policy questions and write a 3-4-page paper answering the policy question. The answer
should site narrative from the book Evicted regarding the Milwaukee context and should also apply a related
interpretation to another U.S. city. OR
● Paper Related to a Policy Issue Described in The Color of Law: The student is expected to choose one of
three instructor proposed policy questions and write a thorough reflection of the policy issue based on the
student’s reflection of the history of the mortgage industry described in The Color of Law.
● Final Exam: The final exam will test similar financial calculations as was asked in Quiz #1. The final exam
will also ask the student to answer essay questions regarding the policy issues covered in class and may
include multiple choice and/or true and false questions.
● Class Attendance / Participation: The student is expected to attend every class and actively participate in the
class discussion. If the student cannot attend a class, the student must send the instructor an e-mail prior to
class with a valid excuse. If the instructor does not receive an e-mail, the student will lose 20% of the
participation grade for every class missed. Assignments are still due even if the student has an excused
absence, unless the reason the student missed class is identified as one of the three reasons in the Latework policy described below.
