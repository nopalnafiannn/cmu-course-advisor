# 94-816: Generative AI: Applications, Implications, and Governance

## Course Information

**Units:** 6

## Description

We have entered the era of Generative AI, which holds transformational potential akin to the industrial revolution or the advent of the Internet. This technology is now capable of comprehending and generating language, code, images, and videos, performing routine digital tasks, and aiding humans in advancing scientific and creative fields. These intelligent capabilities are powering novel AI user experiences such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot and other proprietary and open-source offerings. These innovations can boost human productivity and creativity, but their impact on society is unpredictable long-term. By immersing ourselves in the study of Generative AI, we not only equip ourselves for personal growth but also become architects of a future where we can help steer technology to serve humanity’s highest aspirations. This course explores the broad impacts of generative AI by considering its applications, societal implications, and how organization can govern its usage. We will explore how leveraging AI tools can help us as individuals thrive in our personal and professional lives. We will learn how both governments and private enterprises are seeking to develop beneficial and safe AI aligned with human needs. This course will provide students with practical exposure to the latest AI technologies. Students will learn the art of prompt engineering, how to use AI as a research, writing and thinking tool, and strategies to avoid common AI failure points.
