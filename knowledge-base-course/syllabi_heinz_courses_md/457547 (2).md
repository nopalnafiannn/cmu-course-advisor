Course Description
Arts Enterprises: Structures and Strategy offers emerging arts managers and leaders a deep
understanding of the business structures and strategies involved in running successful
21st-century arts enterprises. Perhaps more importantly, the course provides students with the
opportunity to dissect and understand the complexities of the local, national, and international
forces that make running an arts-based business unique. Almost daily, arts managers are faced
with challenges and problems that affect internal operation dynamics and external stakeholder
relations. A solid structure of values and strategies provides the frameworks to find successful
solutions. During the course, students discover and analyze the operations of well-run, adaptive
arts organizations and investigate moments of failure in order to uncover lessons learned. The
course provides a lens into the nexus of institution-artist-audience within a framework of
mission-impact and ROI.

This course provides students with both the fundamentals and the emerging practices within
arts enterprises. The course also creates a foundation for subsequent, advanced coursework
specific to the MAM curriculum. Students will encounter the economic and sociological
theories necessary to understand for-profit and nonprofit enterprises. These theories become
grounded by engaging in real-life experiences, case studies, and course exercises. The course
is organized into modules : 1) What is Art, Who Says So and Why? 2) Public Policy/Cultural
Policy that Frame Our Work; 3) Business Structures – What There Are and Why Choose Them;
4) Organizational Governance & Leadership; 5) Business Strategies & Operations. These are
not of equal length, but offer a framework for understanding the situation of all arts
enterprises and the considerations for starting something new.

For the purpose of this course, arts enterprises will be defined as those that create
relationships between artists and audiences. Arts enterprises include, but are not limited
to: orchestras, opera companies, music ensembles, museums, arts centers, theatre
companies, presenting organizations, multi-media centers, artist agencies, galleries,
media, and dance companies.

Exams
The final project for the course is the ‘exam’. IN-PERSON ATTENDANCE IS REQUIRED . ABSENCE
WILL RESULT IN A ZERO FOR THE PROJECT GRADE. Often our final exam is scheduled on the
last day of exams (this is outside of my control). NOTE: Schedule any travel for winter break
AFTER the last day of finals.
### Course Requirements & Expectations

Weekly Workload
This is a 12-credit course. It will average 9 - 12 hours of work per week. Those are accounted for by time
in class (3 hours), time preparing for class (3 hours) and time working on homework and projects (3 - 6).

Some weeks may be lighter than others. Some may be heavier. That’s the magic of averages. Please take
time to plan ahead and allow for the time you need for this and all other classes.

Participation & Engagement
At the graduate level, attendance is assumed , except in extraordinary circumstances. In-person
attendance is required for this class. If you are unable to attend, please make every effort to let me or
the TA know, by phone or email, before class begins. You are still responsible for all in-class material. Be
sure to get notes from a classmate or meet with the TA. Unless otherwise noted, classes will NOT be
recorded, but if you are out of class due to isolation for illness, you can contact the TA and observe the
class (if Zoom is available in the classroom). In rare circumstances, the class will be recorded. Recordings
are made available to those with university-recognized absences.

Ultimately, attending graduate school is now your job. As with any job, you are anticipated to have
sick days, but you must notify the TA or Professor with University documentation to follow. 2 absences
(for any reason) are accepted as normal and are built into the grading schema. Attendance will be
taken 5 minutes into class and impacts your final grade. Additional absences (beyond 2) will drop your
final grade by 2%.

Active class participation is expected. The class, while large in number, will offer opportunities to learn
in an active and synergistic manner. Class time will include discussion of assigned readings
/videos/podcasts, engaging with in-class work, doing hands-on activities, and sharing of thoughts and
ideas. Productive participation, for example, clearly leading a group or demonstrating that you have
done the preparation as expected for the class.

Not everyone feels comfortable asking questions or making observations during class time. The course
provides multiple other means for engagement via the Discussion Board and for Q&A, including
dedicated Q&A Discussion Boards.

Arts Participation
TWO arts organization participation opportunities are required for this class and are tied to assignments
and discussion. Details for the performance, museum, and expectation for each prompted analysis are
provided in the Discussion Board.

Extra credit is earned by completing the FCE’s (Faculty Course Evaluation). Everyone in the
class earns a .5% lift to your final grade if 80% of the FCE’s are completed. 1% if 90 or above.

Late Work (see individual assignment rubrics for specifics)
All assignments are due on the date assigned, just as a grant is due on the day it is due. That being said,
Heinz College presents unusual circumstances with sometimes conflicting due dates. Those who plan
ahead and request a formal extension more than 48 hours prior to the due date will be granted up to
one week. Without an approved extension, work received after the due date loses 5% for every 12 hours
late. This does NOT include weekly news discussions which receive a zero if late.

Classroom Decorum
Cell Phones: Please turn off your cell phone and put it away during class. A class is like a performance. At
times, I am the performer, and you are the audience. At other times, you will be the performer and the
rest of the class and I will be your audience. Respect is simple.

Computers: Similarly, computers are useful but distracting tools. Education science has a preponderance
of evidence that reveals how computer use during class diminishes comprehension and retention. While
you will need your computer for in-class work at times, when not required you should leave your
computer in your bag . When used for in-class work, be mindful of their use and utilize focus features to
decrease their distractions. Tablets for note-taking are allowed.

Recording Class Sessions. Classes will NOT be recorded unless due to COVID protocols by CMU or a
student’s prolonged absence due to an acute health situation. Should the campus pivot to Zoom, we
will also be following a shared set of Digital Agreements for Zoom protocols (reviewed should the
situation arrive).

Food/Drink. You are permitted to eat and drink in class as long as you do not disrupt others in the class
and, of course, clean up and dispose of any trash after class and abide by whatever is in effect for CMU
food and masking protocols.
### Intellectual and Professional Integrity

This course is an integral part of your graduate education, an education that is designed to provide you
with the tools for a successful, professional career. Assumed within is a high standard of ethics and
integrity. You are expected to have read and understood the CMU , Heinz College and MAM Student
Handbooks . Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely serious
matters. Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most
serious violations. Cases of cheating and plagiarism will follow the requirements as described in the
handbook. Each and every case will be submitted to and reviewed by the Office of Community Standards
and Integrity where more severe penalties may be imposed, up to and including expulsion from the
university. Any assignment that involves cheating or plagiarism will receive a ‘zero’ for the assignment.

Two confirmed cases of cheating or plagiarism will result in an ‘R’ for the course.

In addition to the guidelines concerning work materials, you are expected to behave in a supportive and
professional manner towards your colleagues/classmates; this includes sharing resources for mutual
benefit, protecting information told in confidence, and helping to create a general classroom climate of
honesty and respect.

Collaboration is expected IN CLASS and any partner work. All work submitted in this class must be your
own. Use of AI or other online assistance on homework or organization analyses is strongly cautioned
against, if you use such a tool, you must report it via citation of your process and how you used the
results. Ultimately your work must reflect your own understanding.

Any student found to be in violation of these policies will incur academic disciplinary actions consistent
with University policies noted above.

Artificial Intelligence
AI will be discussed in class as it affects many operations in administration, from machine learning to
generative AI. We will learn how to use AI for research and ethical and appropriate ways to use it for
assignments. ALL use of AI in your work MUST be indicated clearly, including the tool, prompts, and how
you incorporated it. If your AI work is not indicated or cited, that is plagiarism and will be treated
accordingly.

Respect and Support
In addition to the guidelines concerning work materials, you are expected to behave in a supportive and
professional manner towards your colleagues/classmates; this includes sharing resources for mutual
benefit, protecting information told in confidence, and helping to create a general classroom climate of
honesty and respect.

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds, identities, and perspectives be well served by
this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity
that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. Your suggestions are
encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you
personally or for other students or student groups. In addition, if any of our class meetings conflict with
your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements for you.

All people have the right to be addressed and referred to in accordance with their personal identity. In this
class, we will have the chance to indicate the name that we prefer to be called and the pronouns by
which should be used to refer to us. I will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly and
support classmates in doing so as well.

During the first day of class, we will review the course’s inclusive behavior agreements and edit to meet
the course expectations.
### Special Needs and Interests

My goal is to provide the most effective educational atmosphere for all students. Please let me know, in
confidence, early in the semester if you have any special needs (broadly defined). Also note that the
university provides significant support should you find yourself struggling with writing the
Communications Center and Office for Student Success are both available to you) or with work/life
balance (CaPS).

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you
achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful
resources available on campus and an important part of a professional education experience is learning
how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is
here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/ . Consider
reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support
that can help
### How to succeed in this course:

The key to success in this course is Preparation and Showing Up – by reading/viewing / listening to the
day’s learning materials PRIOR to class you will be best situated to ENGAGE with your peers and in-class
activities. The class assignments build on the knowledge gained during class and in preparation
materials. By gaining proficiency throughout, success in larger assignments is smoother.

Additionally, keeping in communication with your TA and professor along the way is critical to success. If
you have questions – ask them. If you need support, we are here for you.

Finally, time management allows for the preparation, work, and when necessary, request for extensions.

If you are struggling with time-management please let us know and reach out to the Student Success
Center.
