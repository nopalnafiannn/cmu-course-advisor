# COURSE DESCIPTION

This introductory course (there are no prerequisite courses) is designed to
improve your effec8veness as an individual, manager and leader by introducing
you to frameworks for understanding organiza8ons, organiza8onal processes, and
necessary skills. Organiza8ons have been studied from the perspec8ve of several
social science disciplines, including psychology, sociology, economics,
anthropology, and poli8cal science. The field on which this course is based,
organiza8onal behavior, draws from all these disciplines and applies the insights
derived from the per8nent research. This course will introduce you to this
research and offer ways to apply this knowledge situa8onally through analysis and
subsequent class discussion of case studies.

While building the collec8ve technical and quan8ta8ve skills of an organiza8on is
important, the human skills of managing, organizing, and communica8ng are
arguably even more so. The reality is that people, not quan8ta8ve and technical
skills, are the backbone of any organiza8on. And yet, this self-evident fact
con8nues to get overlooked as we presume our own level of competence in this
area. Unfortunately, we tend to overes8mate our human skills and engage our
colleagues in unsystema8c and unreflec8ve ways.

This course is designed to get you thinking more mindfully about how we engage
others in our professional environments. At 8mes we will manage others and at

8mes we will be managed by others. We will always be working with others. As
we progress through the course, we will explore various human elements of
organiza8ons and think about ways in which we can op8mize performance using
what we’ve learned. The course will provide you with opportuni8es to develop
and prac8ce your interpersonal and leadership skills within a team context while
also providing you with an opportunity to reflect and share.

Throughout the course, we will cover several topics including organiza8onal
culture, organiza8onal structure, team dynamics, communica8on,
leadership, social networks, decision making, strategy, diversity and inclusion,
interpersonal rela8onships, personali8es and individual differences, and more.
# LEARNING OUTCOMES

### By the end of this course, students will be able to:

### *  Analyze and assess organiza8onal culture and its impact on organiza8onal

effec8veness.
### *  Evaluate different organiza8onal structures and their implica8ons for

management and policy.
### *  Develop strategies for building and maintaining effec8ve interpersonal

PROFESSOR'S EXPECTATIONS
This course requires significant reading, wri8ng and class par8cipa8on. It is
expected that everyone will come to class prepared to discuss the readings and
that everyone will have answered the study ques8ons. You are encouraged to
discuss reading material before class in a study group with other members of the
class.

My goal is to make this an excellent learning experience for you. If at any 8me
you feel that the course is not mee8ng your expecta8ons, PLEASE CONTACT ME.

Be respec(ul of others: arrive to class on 4me; do not return late from break; if
you must leave class early, please let us know beforehand.
# LEARN IN CLASS

Class begins on 8me each week. Your TA will keep track of aUendance and
par8cipa8on.

I need your full aUen8on. I am asking you not to use a cell phone, laptop, or any
other devices. Why not? See this ar8cle Self-Control .pdfDownload Self-Control
.pdf
Each session will typically have a few readings/case assigned. Please do the
readings prior to the class.
### *  Except for the first lecture, we will begin with ques8ons and comments

inspired by the previous week’s ac8vi8es.
*  Next, I will introduce a new topic. I will endeavor to make this sec8on as
interac8ve as possible
EVALUATION/GRADING
Students will be evaluated based on aUendance, class par8cipa8on, teamwork,
wriUen assignments, and presenta8ons. All grading components are computed on
a point scale as outlined below. The maximum point total one can achieve for the
en8re semester is 300 Final course grades will be assigned as follows:
### Le8er Grade Point Range

A+ 295-300
A 282-294.5
A- 273-281.5
B+ 264-272.5
B 252-263.5

B- 243-251.5
C+ 234-242.5
C 222-233.5
C- 213-221.5
R Below 213
### ATTENDANCE, PARTICIPATION & ENGAGEMENT (A, P, & E)

Each student begins the semester with 50 points (A, P, & E Score). Points are
added or subtracted from A, P, & E Score according to the following:
*  0-10 points are added for class par8cipa8on as evaluated over the course of
the semester by the professor. Everyone is encouraged and expected to
par8cipate in class discussions and ac8vi8es. Sharing your own knowledge
and experience benefits the en8re class. Construc8ve contribu8on to the
class discussion and genuine listening to others is an important element of
class par8cipa8on. Keep in mind that high quality par8cipa8on is the goal,
not high quan8ty of air8me. In other words, it's not how much you talk, it's
what you say that's important.
*  AUendance is taken in all classes, including the first class. If you are absent
from class, 3 points may be deducted from your par8cipa8on score. If you
need to miss a class, please e-mail me with as much advance no8ce as
possible and state the reason for missing class. If it is a valid reason for
missing class, this is an ‘excused absence’ and 3 points will not be
deducted. If it is not a valid reason for missing class – for example, you
slept in or were on vaca8on – this is an ‘unexcused absence’ and 3 points
will be deducted.
*  There is a penalty for excessive absences. If you miss three classes
(including both excused and unexcused absences), 30 points will be
deducted from your final course grade. If you miss four classes, 45 points

will be deducted from your final course grade. If you miss five or more
classes, 60 points will be deducted from your final course grade.
### *  If you are more than a few minutes late arriving to a class, two points will

be deducted from your class par8cipa8on score.
### *  Lastly, technology (phone, computer, ear buds, etc) unless instructed are

not allowed in the class. Please read the sec8ons on 'Learn in Class' and
'Mobile Devices' to understand why not. Anyone using the technology in
class will lose 5 points from the par8cipa8on score.
-The quality of ODI course depends on your engagement, par4cipa4on, and
desire to learn. Bring energy and enthusiasm to the class so we can have a
robust experience.
# WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS

You are required to complete five individual wriUen assignments. Please refer to
the 'Assignments' sec8on on Canvas.
# FEEDBACK MECHANISM

The way ODI is designed, students engage in several hands-on ac8vi8es and
feedback is embedded in the class ac8vi8es and lectures. Pay aUen8on specially
to lectures and ac8vi8es wrap-up. The instructor will also provide construc8ve
feedback to each student and project groups from 8me to 8me. The feedback will
cover topics including, but not limited to, class par8cipa8on, reflec8on entries.
self-assessment, project progress, check-ins, etc.

Addi8onally, students are highly encouraged to stop by her office during her office
hours to have informal conversa8ons.
# MOBILE DEVICES

As research on learning shows, unexpected noises and movement automa8cally
divert and capture people's aUen8on, which means you are affec8ng everyone’s
learning experience if your cell phone, pager, laptop, etc. makes noise or is visually
distrac8ng during class.

For this reason, I ask you to turn off your mobile devices and laptops.

Here is an interes8ng study on how the use of smartphones reduces available
cogni8ve capacity.

# RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspec8ves be well
served by this course. While diversity may recall familiar subdivisions such as race,
color, na8onal origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orienta8on, and the like,
I would also encourage you to think in terms of things like work styles,
communica8on styles, skills, and abili8es. Respect and apprecia8on for the
variety of talents, styles and approaches will be a major theme in this course.

When we find ourselves in disagreements in the classroom or in our project
groups, let us pledge to seUle our disagreements in good faith by trea8ng each
other with the utmost respect and truly listening to one another with intent to
understand.
# ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

If you have a disability and require accommoda8ons, please contact Catherine
Getchell, Director of Disability Resources, 412-268-6121, getchell@cmu.edu. If
you have an accommoda8ons leUer from the Disability Resources office, I
encourage you to discuss your accommoda8ons and needs with me as early in the
semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommoda8ons are
provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would

benefit from accommoda8ons but are not yet registered with the Office of
Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them
at access@andrew.cmu.edu.
# ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

Honesty and transparency are important features of good scholarship. On the flip
side, plagiarism and chea8ng are serious academic offenses with serious
consequences. If you are discovered to be engaging in either behavior in this
course, you will earn a failing grade on the assignment in ques8on, and further
disciplinary ac8on may be taken.

For a clear descrip8on of what counts as plagiarism, chea8ng, and/or the use of
unauthorized sources, please see the University’s Policy on Academic Integrity:
USE OF GENERATIVE AI PROGRAMS (ChatGPT, DALL-E, ETC.)
### Facts and Evidence:

## 1. The main purpose of being a student is to learn and become a cri8cal thinker. AI

can nega8vely impact
our ability to learn and cri8cally analyze and resolve situa8ons/problems.
## 2. AI can be factually incorrect, i.e. it ‘hallucinates’.

## 3. AI currently does not cite sources, which is unacceptable in an academic seNng

(plagiarism).
### Requirements and Expecta]ons:

## 1. Using AI for grammar and wri8ng style is acceptable. For example, many

students use ‘Grammarly’.
## 2. Entering the assignment ques8on into AI and then having AI write your paper or

sec8ons of your paper
is not acceptable.
## 3. If you use AI on your paper (this does not include Microsop Word spell check

and Microsop Word
grammar check), you must inform the professor. Write the AI plaqorm you used,
the reason you used
it, and how it helped you – enter this informa8on in the ‘Assignment Comments’
field for the
assignment in Canvas.

4. f you are concerned about how your use of AI may impact your grade and
performance in the course,
please contact the professor before you use AI for an assignment.
### AI and Academic Integrity:

Using AI for any purposes or in any manner other than described above will be
considered an academic integrity viola8on, resul8ng in a score of ‘0’ points for
that assignment
AND resul8ng in either a reduced course grade or a failing course grade.
# YOUR WELLNESS

ea8ng well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, geNng enough sleep, and
taking some 8me to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with
stress.

All of us benefit from support during 8mes of struggle. There are many helpful
resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is
learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost
always helpful.
