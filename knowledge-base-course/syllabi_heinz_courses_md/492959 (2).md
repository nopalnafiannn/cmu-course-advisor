Important Note
I want to do everything I can to support you. To do this, though, I need to know about a problem
when it starts, not after it has already derailed your ability to keep up with the class. Letting me
know sooner rather than later is key. I am in a better position to help you and find resources to
assist if you tell me when the problem arises. It is much harder, and in some cases, impossible
to do this if you wait until the end of the term. To do so, you can email me or come to office
hours.

The upshot is that I am here to help and care. If you are having life issues that are making it
hard for you to keep up with the class, please let me know.

Course Description
This course explores the relationship between media and politics in contemporary America and
grapples with the influence of mass and social media on Americans' political attitudes, beliefs, and
behaviors. We will consider the power of media to persuade, the extent to which media outlets are
ideologically slanted, the role of new information technologies, and associated policy challenges. We
will further consider how the media's stewardship of American democracy evolved over time. The
media is ever-changing, and as such, this course is designed to raise questions that may not have
clear or easy answers. However, students should leave this course equipped with the knowledge and
tools to develop their own understanding of the complex relationship between the media and politics.

Learning Objectives
### At the conclusion of this course, students should be able to:

### *  Summarize and describe current public policy challenges related to the media in US Politics

### *  Identify the historical role of the media in US Politics and its influence on current media

regulation.
*  Present policy solutions and recommend solutions to relevant stakeholders.
*  Effectively communicate perspectives on the media and politics in writing.
*  Plan, organize, and deliver coordinated work targeted at a goal.

Assessments
### The final course grade will be calculated using the following categories:

### Assessment Percentage of Due Date

Final Grade
Canvas and Syllabus Quiz 5% January 21st@11:59 pm
Reading Notes and Discussion 25% (Assigned Class Date)

Extra Credit Civic Engagement + 3 % Extra Credit March 1st@11:59 pm
Activity
● Canvas and Syllabus Quiz: Students will complete a brief online assessment to ensure
comprehension of course details outlined in the syllabus. The quiz is posted on Canvas. The
quiz is open book and notes but cannot be completed with other students’ assistance. All
answers for the quiz are provided either on Canvas or in the syllabus. This assignment must
be completed by 11:59 pm on Tuesday, January 21st.
● Reading Notes and Discussion Leading: Students will write notes and present on the
course readings for one class during the term. Your job will be to summarize the readings in a
short document posted on Canvas by 11:59 pm the night before your presentation for your
classmates and then provide a brief 5-minute presentation of the readings at the beginning of
class, followed by a short discussion. Specific guidelines will be provided on Canvas.

In-class presentations should not copy the content provided in your reading notes. You
should assume your colleagues have completed all the appropriate readings and read your
notes before class. Instead, you should focus on themes that tie the readings together and
questions or thoughts you had that will provide a foundation to start our class discussion.
● Policy Memo: Students will write a policy memo (1) identifying a concern with media
regulation in the United States other than the topic of your presentation and (2) outlining a
recommended policy intervention. Additional information and requirements for this project will
be posted on Canvas and the project will be due on February 23rd at 11:59 pm. The goal of
,
this assignment is to build your skills in identifying and summarizing a problem, presenting
potential solutions, and recommending a solution to others. Please write your paper with
changes tracked in Google Docs.
● Class Presentation: In groups of 2-3 students, you will work to learn more about a specific
topic and prepare a class presentation using either a PowerPoint or class handouts. You will
be expected to meet with the instructor at least one week prior to your presentation date.

Additionally, slides or class handouts should be submitted at least 48 hours before your
presentation date. The instructor will review the presentation materials to ensure that they are
effective. Additional guidelines will be provided on campus.

During the 2nd week of classes, students will be asked to select topics for the class
presentation, and the instructor will assign groups based on those stated preferences.
● Extra-Credit Civic Engagement Activity: First-hand experience and civic engagement
provide an insight into American politics that I can never replicate in a course setting or
simulation. That said, I am cognizant of various barriers that would make a formal assignment
requiring participation unfair. To encourage such participation, I’m offering up to 3 percent
extra credit not to exceed a final course grade of more than 100% for any student that:
(1) Participates in volunteer work or interacts with a non-profit, government agency, grassroots
organization at some point after the start of this class. These activities include but are not
limited to going to a local government town hall, volunteering as a poll worker, attending a
campaign event, watching a congressional hearing online, or even watching past campaign
rallies on YouTube.1 Please note that you do not need to participate in a partisan or
government-sponsored event to complete this activity as long as you can link the
activity to the media and politics and is completed after the start of our class. If an
online option is chosen, the engagement must be equivalent to the time it would take to
attend a meeting in person (at least 1 hour in length).
# AND

(2) Writes a 500-word, single-spaced reflection on your experience, tying what you learned to a
concept studied in our class. Details for this assignment will be on Canvas, including
formatting expectations. This paper must be completed and submitted by 11:59 pm March
1st.

Course Policies
● Make-up and Late work policy: Due dates for every assignment are provided on the course
syllabus and posted in Canvas. Unless otherwise stated, assignments are due on those days.

However, I recognize that sometimes “life happens.” In these instances, you are allotted one
flex day for use during the semester. These days allow you to submit one assignment one day
late without penalty. You can use this day for any reason. You do not need to provide me with
the explanation: simply email me and tell me you would like to use your flex day and include
this information at the top of your submitted assignment. Flex dates cannot be used for
group assignments or presentations.

Once you’ve exhausted your flex day, point deductions will occur for any assignment submitted
1 Working at a soup kitchen or other non-political volunteering is fine for this project as long as you take the time to relate
your experiences back to the media and politics in your reflection paper.
after the deadline. A late assignment submitted within 24 hours of the due date will only be
eligible for 80% of the maximum number of points allotted. From 24-48 hours after the
deadline, assignments will be eligible for 60% of the maximum number of points allotted.

Assignments submitted more than 48 hours after the due date will not be accepted. If you
experience extenuating circumstances (e.g., you are hospitalized) that prohibit you from
submitting your assignments on time, please let me know. I will evaluate these instances on a
case-by-case basis and will require documentation.

For extenuating circumstances, you must contact me before the deadline for the project
passes.
● Attendance and participation policy: Attendance for this course is mandatory. Course
Discussions are designed to ensure that you learn not just from your instructor but also from
your peers. Each student who stays home from class or does not contribute is a lost
perspective and a counterpoint that could have been raised.

Please come to class prepared, having read, viewed, or listened to the assigned materials.
### Quality comments in a course discussion include at least one of the following characteristics:

o Builds on another comment
o Contributes toward moving the discussion or analysis forward
o Offers a different and unique perspective that is relevant to the discussion
o Demonstrates reflective thinking that includes some evidence, argumentation, or
recognition of inherent tradeoffs.
### Students who do not attend class will have their final grades reduced as follows:

o 2 unexcused absences: One-point reduction in grade (i.e., from A to B)
o 3-4 unexcused absences: Two-point reduction in grade (i.e., from A to C)
o 5+ unexcused absences: Students will fail the course
That said, please do not come to class sick. If you are ill or have been exposed to COVID-19
and are worried about attending class, I ask that you first email me. If you feel well enough to
participate in class, I will make every effort to include you in class via a virtual method, like
Zoom. If you cannot attend a class session due to sickness or a school-sanctioned event,
please email me at least 2 hours before the missed class to ensure it is an excused absence.
● News Consumption: Thinking about the relationship between the news media and politics
requires maintaining familiarity with the news, how it’s covered, and the organizations and
personalities behind the production of news. I HIGHLY recommend all students regularly read
the political news coverage from one of the major national newspapers (in print or online): The
New York Times, The Washington Post, or The Wall Street Journal. In addition, please choose
another supplementary news source to read or watch at least weekly, such as Breitbart,
National Review, Politico, Slate, Talking Points Memo, the Weekly Standard, ThinkProgress,
or any cable news programming (for example, CNN, Fox News, or MSNBC). Please also
watch for different political news content you encounter on your social media accounts.
● Re-grade policy: I will strive to assign grades that fairly and accurately reflect the quality of
the work you submit. Any requests for re-grades must be submitted to me in writing within one
week of receiving your graded work back, and you must explain in writing why you feel your
grade was inappropriate. Regrades can result in raising or lowering your initial grade. I will only
regrade assignments in cases where a grade change may alter your final grade in the course.
● Recording Classes: No student may record classroom activity without my written consent.

We discuss sensitive topics in class, and each student should feel comfortable contributing.

That said, if you have (or think you may have) a disability such that you need to record or tape
classroom activities, please contact the Office of Disability Resources to request an
appropriate accommodation.
● Academic Integrity & Collaboration: Honesty and transparency are important features of
good scholarship. Conversely, plagiarism and cheating are serious academic offenses with
serious consequences. If you are discovered engaging in either behavior in this course, you
will earn a failing grade on the assignment in question, and further disciplinary action will be
taken. For a clear description of what counts as plagiarism, cheating, and/or the use of
unauthorized sources and tools, please see the University’s Policy on Academic Integrity
(revised in April 2013): https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academicintegrity.html
I encourage you to use campus resources like the Student Academic Success Center
(SASC) to assist you in your pursuit of academic excellence. However, please note that in
accordance with the university’s policy, you must acknowledge any collaboration or assistance
that you receive on work that is to be graded, either from a person, reference, or a tool
(including tools like Grammarly). So, when you turn in any assignments, please include a
sentence at the end that says either:
“I worked alone on this assignment.”, or
“I worked with __________ [person or tool] on this assignment.” and/or
“I received assistance from _________ [person or tool] on this assignment.”
Note that providing this information will not impact your grade and will only serve to help me
understand you better.

If you have questions about my integration of the university’s policy into this course, please do
not hesitate to ask. I aim to foster an environment where you can learn and grow while
ensuring that the work we all do is honest and fair. For more information about Carnegie
Mellon’s standards concerning academic integrity, you can also check out the following
link: http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/
● Use of Artificial Intelligence/Chat GPT: Assignments in this course are designed to improve
your communication skills and ability to apply class concepts in your arguments. I also hope
written assignments from this class can be used as writing samples for job applications. To
best support your learning and future career development, you may not use generative AI tools
to build the arguments in your paper or write any component of your project, including
brainstorming topics. These activities are essential for developing the fundamental skills and
expertise represented by the learning objectives of this course. Generative AI tools rely on
probabilistic models to generate content, which may sometimes be incomplete, inaccurate,
unoriginal, or biased. I have even seen AI plagiarizing content without a student’s knowledge.

An AI tool should not be considered a substitute for traditional approaches to research.

You are ultimately responsible for the content of the information you submit and may not
attempt to pass off work generated by an AI program as your own. All written submissions
must be submitted with changes tracked.

Passing off any AI-generated content as your own (e.g., cutting and pasting content into
written assignments, paraphrasing AI content, or using AI to brainstorm your paper
topic) constitutes a violation of CMU’s academic integrity policy.2
However, there is one major exception. Generative AI is a powerful tool for gaining feedback
on the quality of your paper and identifying strengths and weaknesses before submitting final
drafts. In this spirit, you may use generative AI tools to obtain feedback on the strengths and
weaknesses of your paper. This feedback can help you identify areas for improvement in your
writing. As an important line, this process will be considered academic dishonesty if generative
AI changes your paper’s text or re-writes/constructs your thesis, argument, or examples . You
must implement any recommendations made on your own. An example of an appropriate
prompt is provided here.3 If you choose to use generative AI in this spirit, you must cite the
generative AI platform used and submit a log of prompts you use when interacting with
generative AI.

If you have any questions about using generative AI in this course, please email or talk to me.
● Accommodations for students with disabilities: If you have a disability and require
accommodations, please contact Catherine Getchell, Director of Disability Resources, at 412268-6121, getchell@cmu.edu. If you have an accommodations letter from the Disability
Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me
as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are
provided as appropriate.
● Statement on student wellness: As a student, you may experience a range of challenges
that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance
use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating, and/or lack of motivation. These mental health
concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your
ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and treatment does work.

You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus
at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and
Psychological Services: 412-268-2922.

A more detailed statement on support systems is included at the end of this syllabus. It
provides a list of resources beyond Counseling and Psychological Services to help you
succeed in your academic journey. Please use these resources at your discretion and feel free
to share them with other members of the CMU community where relevant.
● Diversity Statement: We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many
ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive
campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including
2 For the purposes of this policy, I do not consider the basic functions of Grammarly including language and grammar
edits as Generative AI. However, Grammarly has an AI component that generates text as you write. This latter option is
considered use of Generative AI and is not allowed.
3 This link is for OpenAI’s ChatGPT which is not approved software by the university. The same prompt can be copied and
used with Microsoft Copilot. You can access Microsoft Copilot through your university login.
but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation,
gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of
these diverse identities, and many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our
students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We at CMU will work to promote diversity,
equity, and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation but because
we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the
work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community
that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer,
more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional.

They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the
university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or
hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support within the moment
of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the
following resources:
Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a report by
calling 844-587-0793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com.

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following
actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform
our campus climate to be more equitable and just.
● Devices Policy: I have a strong preference for no technology in the classroom. Research
shows that students who write notes retain more information from courses than those who do
so via typing. (Article) Moreover, frequent focus on a computer screen can be disruptive. As a
discussion-focused course, computer screens can also create a distance in discussions and
impede full participation. If you must use an electronic device for this purpose, you may do so
under the condition that you use it responsibly and only to take notes. Please do not engage in
emailing, cell phone use, texting, tweeting, social media messaging, or web browsing in class.

If there is an emergency and you must send a message, please step out of the classroom.
● Land Acknowledgement: The land on which we are learning, working, and growing is part of
the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the Osage. We pay respect to the Osage peoples
past, present, and future.

### Description and Breakdown of Readings:

All readings are required. All are linked in this document and/or provided through the course Canvas
site in Modules.

Comment on Readings: I believe in incorporating a wide array of people and perspectives in
this class. This commitment means making sure that we cover the work of scholars from diverse
backgrounds. This integration of diverse perspectives is often less explicit as we use examples
from a variety of people and places to illustrate arguments and motivate thought. I’ve worked on
this balance through discussions with colleagues. I won’t be perfect, but I will continue to work
on making this class a place where everyone can find something new to become fascinated and
challenged by the media and public policy. Please come talk to me with positive and negative
feedback as well as readings of interest. My office door, email inbox, and ears are always open.

I appreciate when students provide feedback, and I promise a safe space free from retaliation
for these conversations.
