# 95-746: Cloud Security

## Course Information

**Units:** 6

## Description

This course comprehensively explores the intricate security challenges and leading-edge solutions in contemporary cloud environments. Students will develop a deep understanding of fundamental cloud security concepts, architectural models, and risk mitigation strategies. The course delves into the distinctions between conventional and cloud-native security paradigms, addressing evolving risk management philosophies crucial to safeguarding cloud-based assets. The course emphasizes a hands-on approach, enabling students to apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios within simulated cloud environments. Graduates will possess the expertise to provide immediate strategic value to infrastructure and security teams within any cloud-reliant organization. Throughout the course, students will engage with contemporary cloud security challengesâ€”from architecting resilient cloud infrastructure and implementing robust data security measures to designing cloud-native Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions and addressing compliance mandates. The curriculum incorporates emerging trends and technologies, ensuring graduates are equipped to tackle the evolving threat landscape of cloud computing and make informed strategic decisions within organizations that rely on cloud-based services.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Understand fundamental concepts of cloud security, including principles of data encryption, network security, and access control.
2. Compare and contrast conventional security practices with cloud-native security paradigms, identifying key differences and implications for risk management.
3. Analyze various architectural models for cloud environments, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses in terms of security posture.
4. Assess risks associated with cloud-based assets and formulate effective risk mitigation strategies tailored to cloud environments.
5. Implement robust data security measures in cloud environments, including encryption, data masking, and secure data transfer protocols.
6. Design and deploy cloud-native Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions, integrating principles of least privilege and multi-factor authentication.
7. Demonstrate compliance with relevant regulatory mandates and industry standards in cloud environments, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2.
8. Apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios within simulated cloud environments, gaining hands-on experience with cloud security tools and techniques.
9. Evaluate emerging trends and technologies in cloud security, staying abreast of developments to inform strategic decision-making in cloud-reliant organizations.
