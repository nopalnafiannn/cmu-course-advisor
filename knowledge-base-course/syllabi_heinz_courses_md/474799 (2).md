Plagiarism and Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely serious matters.
cheating notice* Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious
violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or as
cheating on an examination, including take-home as well as in-class examinations. The punishment for
such offenses can involve expulsion from the MEIM Program and Heinz School.
### Cheating includes but is not limited to:

## 1. Plagiarism (explained below);

## 2. Submission of work that is not the student’s own;

## 3. Submission or use of falsified data;

## 4. Unauthorized access to an exam or assignment;

## 5. Use of a stand‐in for an exam;

## 6. Use of unauthorized material in the preparation of an assignment or during an examination;

## 7. Supplying or communicating unauthorized information to another student for use in an assignment or

exam;
## 8. Unauthorized collaboration on an assignment. Collaboration must be explicitly permitted by an

instructor for it to be considered authorized.
## 9. Submission of the same work for credit in more than one course.

Plagiarism is the failure to indicate the source of work either with quotation marks or
footnotes. The source can be a phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific language, or an idea derived
from the work of another person. Note that material on the web is another person’s work and is

therefore equally subject to the rules on plagiarism and cheating as any other source material.

Cheating and/or plagiarism on an essay assignment will result in a failing grade (0 points) for
that assignment. The essay in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the offending
student’s assignments included in grade calculations; the points for that essay zero (0) will be factored
into the grade.

Furthermore, the cheating student’s final grade will be reduced one full letter grade. A cheating
student’s final grade will be impacted significantly. In addition, cases of cheating and plagiarism will
be submitted to and reviewed by the Dean’s Office; more severe penalties may be imposed, up to and
including expulsion from the Heinz School.

Academic Dishonesty: Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards inside and
outside the classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e., plagiarism and unauthorized
collaboration) is obviously discouraged and will be treated appropriately. The usual penalty for
violations is a failing grade for the particular assignment in question; however, in some instances, such
actions may result in a failing grade for the course.

Artificial
Within this class, there are situations and contexts where you will be permitted to use AI programs such
Intelligence Policy
as ChatGPT, DALL-E and others. Outside of these specific guided activities, you will not be permitted
to use AI tools for any reason.

Using ChatGPT or other generative AI outside of these specific guided activities or to generate any
other course content will be considered an academic integrity violation.
### You May Use AI, but it is not required:

● In your Final Project:
### *  To design your presentation

### *  To research your show

### *  To create your video asset; but please note that if you elect to use generative

video, your video will be judged on a different scale than if you do not, as
outlined in the assignment.
### You May NOT Use AI:

● In your Successful/Unsuccessful Marketing Analysis Assignment
● In brainstorming or ideation for any project
● To generate any written or oral (scripted) communication
If you wish to use AI in another capacity in this class, it must be discussed IN ADVANCE with the
Instructor and if allowed, will be subject to restrictions.
### ● If you do use AI:

*  You must acknowledge the use of AI tools within your work.
### *  You should recognize that large language models often provide incorrect

information, fake citations, contradictory statements or incorporate
plagiarized materials
