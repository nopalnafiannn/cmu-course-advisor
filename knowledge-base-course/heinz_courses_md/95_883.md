# 95-883: Ethical Penetration Testing

## Course Information

**Units:** 6

## Description

This course will introduce students to professional penetration testing by teaching offensive tactics along with the appropriate methodologies and responsibilities it takes to ethically attack systems. The majority of time will be spent in hands-on labs performing reconnaissance, discovering vulnerabilities, developing exploits, and carefully penetrating targets.

## Learning Outcomes
