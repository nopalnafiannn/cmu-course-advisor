I. Course Description
Strategic Presentation Skills provides practical instruction for preparing and delivering
professional presentations. Activities and assignments include: developing targeted, strategic
messages; writing outlines; creating cohesive visuals; exploring new technologies; and, speaking
extemporaneously. Students engage specific audiences using a communication style (both verbal
and nonverbal) suitable for workplace environments. Overall, the course helps students develop
confidence and apply effective techniques when speaking in a public setting.

Note: This course assumes proficiency in English grammar. Numerous resources for improving
written English skills are provided via Canvas.

II. Text(s)
Selected texts to be provided by the instructor
III. Objectives
A. Compare and contrast effective versus ineffective professional presentations
B. Conduct an audience analysis and adapt messages to particular audience members
C. Establish presence through professional attire, appropriate posture, and purposeful
gestures
D. Structure a logical, cohesive message via verbal and visual transitional devices
E. Maintain time constraints, a consistent pace, adequate volume and clarity in voice
projection, and eye contact
F. Design and utilize visuals (e.g. slides, logos, photographs, tables, graphs, charts, and
diagrams) effectively
G. Demonstrate the use of advanced presentation technologies as a method of
delivering content
H. Generate interaction with attendees and respond eloquently to questions from the
audience
I. Self-evaluate professional development as a public speaker
IV. Registration
Once a section of Strategic Presentation Skills is full, then enrollment is dependent on: (1) the
number of registered students who drop the section, and (2) the waitlist order. Students who miss

the first class meeting can be automatically dropped from the course. After the initial session,
registration is closed. Priority registration may be given to students for whom Strategic
Presentation Skills is required (including BSCF seniors).

V. Classroom Policies
Professional conduct is necessary. While our class is in session, act as though you are in a staff
or client meeting. For example, refrain from: accessing personal messages; sleeping; or, doing
other coursework. Demonstrate respect for everyone in the room through active listening, eye
contact, and productive (skills-focused) comments.
# ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION

This course consists of lectures, discussions, impromptu speaking exercises, and planned
presentations. Attendance is required; it is particularly important given the concentrated schedule
of the mini format and to benefit from speaking exercises conducted during class. For this
reason, a failing grade for the course will be issued for three or more unexcused absences. In
addition to attendance, participation includes engaging in class discussions, skills-building
exercises, and TA sessions. The course grade can be lowered as a result of: lateness, unexcused
absences, using a mobile device in class (unless for a class exercise or presentation), or
inadequate preparation for class exercises.
# WELLNESS

Carnegie Mellon University has a wide array of resources and programs to support student
wellness. Students are encouraged to access these resources, and to contact the instructor if a
health or safety concern arises.

VI. Written Assignments
Instructions for assignments will be posted to Canvas and explained in detail during class.

Written assignments (Audience Analysis, Key Points with Q & A, and Visuals) are due as an
upload to Canvas (in designated area) and as a printed copy in class by the start of our session on
the dates stipulated in the syllabus. Include your name and section in the file. Presentations may
be staggered over two class meetings (given time constraints); however, every student must be
prepared to present on the due date stated in the syllabus.

POLICY ON EXTENTIONS Assignments submitted past the due date and time earn a failing
grade unless: (1) a religious observance or a documented medical condition prevents on-time
submission; and, (2) the student has consulted with the instructor in advance for approval of an
alternate deadline.
# LATE ASSIGNMENT POLICY

If a student submits a paper late, the student may be jeopardizing their ability to receive
comments on the first and final draft.

While allotments can be made for extenuating circumstances, if the assignment is handed in late,
half of a letter grade will be deducted from the overall score, for every day past the due date. For
instance, if you submit an assignment two days late, then the highest grade you can receive is
90%.

# PURPOSE OF DRAFTS

Drafts serve as preparation for individual meetings with instructor or the TA and for peer-review
sessions for feedback prior to submitting the final, graded version. Further, drafts are useful for
time management. Drafts are graded upon completion. Grade deductions will occur if a draft is
incomplete, or if there is a lack of participation during the guided editing sessions.

Drafts should be submitted as a stapled hard copy during class, on the corresponding due date(s).
# POLICY ON STUDENT ACCOMMODATIONS

The Carnegie Mellon University Office of Disability Resources reviews requests for “reasonable
accommodations, academic adjustments, and auxiliary aids and services.”1 Students can work
with the instructor to arrange accommodations as needed on a case-by-case basis once
accommodations are granted by the Office of Disability Resources.

VII. Academic Conduct
Assignments are submitted via Turnitin. This technology compares documents with contact
available on the internet and with files previously uploaded. The site generates a report
indicating matching content. If an academic integrity violation is suspected, the student will be
contacted to meet with the instructor to determine if a violation has occurred based on Carnegie
### Mellon University’s Policy on Academic Integrity. Not that plagiarism includes:

### *  Presenting another writer’s work as your own

### *  Cutting and pasting contact verbatim without using quotation marks to indicate a direct

quote
### *  Inserting a direct quote or paraphrasing without citing the source

### *  Providing incomplete or incorrect information about the source cited

### *  Over-relying on templates or another writers’ phrasing
