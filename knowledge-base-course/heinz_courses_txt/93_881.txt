# 93-881: Les Paul: A Journey Through Music and Innovation

## Course Information

**Units:** 1

## Description

Recorded music has existed for 165 years, producing remarkable artists, engineers, and technicians, but few true inventors. Les Paul stands out as a visionary who invented the modern recording studio, introducing multi-track recording, digital delay, reverb, and echo. He also created the electric pickup, leading to the first solid-body electric guitar. Without his innovations, iconic works like The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, Legendary Guitarist, Eddie Van Halen, Pro Tools, and Garage Band might not exist. Despite receiving numerous honors and awards throughout his lifetime, including being named the 18th best guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine, Les Paul is among the few artists to have a permanent exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Additionally, he is the only individual to be inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the National Inventors Hall of Fame. This course explores Les Paul’s transformative contributions and artistic achievements. Alongside his partner Mary Ford, Paul had over 33 Top 20 hits across Jazz, Pop, Country, and R&B. Despite his unmatched influence, many remember him primarily as a legacy artist. Through lectures at the MEIM, Los Angeles campus, and a hands-on session at The Les Paul Studio at United Recording in Hollywood, students will experience Les Paul's original mixing board and engage with top studio producers. This course is designed for both music enthusiasts and anyone interested in the history, innovation, and technology of modern music.
