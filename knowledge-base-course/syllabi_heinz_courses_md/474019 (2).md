“ … you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.
“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I say—that's the same thing, you know.”
“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter.

## 1. Course Description

This course focuses on creating and delivering credible, professional, and meaningful presentations for a
variety of audiences. Students will learn to connect with their audiences and increase their confidence
when standing before a group or camera. These skills are important to students, job-seekers, and
professionals, and while the experience of presenting isn’t everyone’s favorite (or forte), they are
frequently evaluated across most career industries. In addition to honing their own techniques, students
will also learn to work together to deliver a message as a group, as well as gain tips to relax and avoid
common presentation pitfalls.
## 2. Course Objectives

The following learning objectives will be assessed through student individual and group presentations and
self/peer evaluations:
### *  Identify and use appropriate elements for effective presentations

### *  Adapt message accordingly to connect with audiences

### *  Design and deliver logical, evidence-based, trustworthy information in an accessible format

### *  Differentiate techniques necessary for specific types of presentations

## 3. Course Materials

There are no required books for this class, however, articles and videos may be assigned and provided
throughout the course at the professor’s discretion. All rubrics for presentations will be posted in Canvas.

## 4. Expectations

This class naturally makes many students nervous. Being evaluated on the spot by professors and peers is
uncomfortable for a lot of people. It’s expected that everyone will show respect to one another. Please
note, there is a difference between anxiety and lack of preparedness, and it is usually obvious. It is
expected that everyone will arrive prepared on days where there are student presentations, with no
exceptions. Students should be patient with one another while also holding presenters to the standards
outlined in all rubrics.

My goal is to make this a pleasant learning experience for you. I ask that you be respectful of others by
arriving to class on time and not using your electronic devices in class without discussing the purpose
with me first. Please let me know if you do not understand class material or requirements or if any
special circumstance prevents you from completing a class requirement on time.
## 5. Evaluation/Grading

All assignments and class participation are graded on a point scale as outlined below. The maximum
points one can achieve for the entire semester is 210.

Attendance is critical to success in this class. Not only will you learn much from each other, but you are
also required to evaluate each presentation made, and you cannot do that if you don’t witness them.

Engagement points are awarded; students are expected to support one another and encouraged to
respond to presenters’ invitations for questions. It is not possible to pass this class if more than two
classes are missed. It is not possible to pass this course without completing all assignments.
### Final course grades will be assigned as follows:

*  A+: 95%-100% A: 90%-94.99% A-: 85% – 89.99%
*  B+ 80% – 84.99 %, B 75% – 79.99% B- 70% – 74.99%
*  C+ 65% – 69.99% C 60% – 64.99 % C- 55% – 59.99 %

## 6. Academic Integrity

You are responsible to know and adhere to all University policies on academic integrity. The Heinz
School provides a booklet on Plagiarism and Cheating and the University lists all policies on the web
at www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Cheating.html. Please acquaint yourself with their contents.

Any cheating or plagiarism will result in failure in the course and your case will be referred to the
Associate Dean, who may decide to take further action.

Although it seems difficult to cheat in a class where you’re presenting, it’s not impossible. To avoid
plagiarism, make certain you cite all sources. If you’re not sure whether or not you need to cite
something, cite it. You’re not expected to come up with all new, brilliant ideas for every assignment.

You can talk about what makes someone else’s ideas brilliant, though, and meet with great success. In
other words, be yourself, show your brain, and acknowledge that there are other smart people in the
world who have contributed to this topic.
## 7. Recording academic classroom activities, lectures, etc.

Classroom activities, lectures, etc. may not be recorded by anyone other than myself without written
permission in advance.
## 8. Use of electronic devices

Few things make presenters feel worse than an inattentive audience. Even boring presenters hate to see
the tops of heads rather than faces (or that tell-tale expression when you’re looking at another screen on
Zoom). Please don’t disrespect each other by performing unrelated activities during class. Unless proof
of necessary accommodation is provided, no student may have their laptop open in class.

### Please note:

Student Wellness - The last few years have been challenging. We are all under a lot of stress and
uncertainty at this time. I encourage you to find ways to move regularly, eat well, and reach out to your
support system or me [rebekaha@andrew.cmu.edu] if you need. We can all benefit from support in times
of stress, and this semester is no exception.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety
or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS)
is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website athttp://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider
reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that
can help.

If you are worried about affording food or feeling insecure about food, there are resources on campus that
can help. Email the CMU Food Pantry Coordinator to schedule an appointment: Pantry Coordinator, cmupantry@andrew.cmu.edu, 412-268-8704 (SLICE office).

CMU offers resources for students with international status, who primarily speak languages other than
English, and/or have attended high school or undergraduate programs in the US. If you or someone you
know is interested in honing language and cross-cultural skills for academic and professional success,
please visit: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/programs/language-support/index.html.
### Diversity Statement:

We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is
fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can
refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin,
language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran
status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned
here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work
to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but
because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the
work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that
increasingly embraces these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They
contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university.

Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on
the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the
incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:
Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: reportit.net username: tartans password: plaid
All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions.

Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus
climate to be more equitable and just.

Accommodations for Students with Disabilities - If you have a disability and have an accommodations
letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs
with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are
provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from
accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to
contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.
