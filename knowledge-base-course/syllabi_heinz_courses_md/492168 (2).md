Grading: 40% homework (approximately every two weeks)

Prerequisites: Statistical Theory for Social and Policy Research (90-905) and
## Introduction to Econometric Theory (90-906), or equivalent PhD-level

econometrics with extensive coverage of linear regressions and sufficient
treatment of asymptotic theory. It is assumed that students are familiar
with basic linear algebra, multivariate calculus, probability theory, and
statistical convergence concepts.

Textbooks/Website
Wooldridge, Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, 1st or 2nd edition. (required)
Cameron and Trivedi, Microeconometrics: Methods and Applications, 2005. (recommended)
Greene, Econometric Analysis, Sixth Edition, 2008. (additional supplement)
Course website is on Canvas. Readings and assignments will be posted there.

Computer Software
Many homework assignments will involve data analysis that requires specialized statistical
software. You are free to use any software that you like. We will provide instruction and
support for Stata, which is available on the Heinz PhD server and via the virtual lab. Some

assignments will require a symbolic programming language (i.e., not pre-packaged estimation
commands), and for this we will provide instruction and support for Matlab and R. Some class
examples may be given in Matlab.

Course Description
This course covers a number of econometric models and techniques that are commonly used in
applied microeconomics. The core topics include a general framework for estimators (which
includes maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments), discrete outcome models,
sample selection (and related limited dependent variable or switching models), duration and
count models, time series models, panel data models, variance estimation (including clustering
and the bootstrap), and non-parametric techniques. The course is designed for PhD students who
have completed 90-906 (PhD Econometrics I) or an equivalent course.

Course Objectives
## 1. Understand the fundamental properties of M-estimators, both formally and intuitively.

## 2. Formulate appropriate econometric models for specific applications within the classes of

data covered by the course, addressing issues of endogeneity and error correlation.
## 3. Derive properties of the estimators based on the above models.

## 4. Apply these estimators to data provided as part of course assignments.

Course Policies
Please write up solutions in LaTeX and submit online by midnight of the due date. Students may
work on the assignments in groups—in fact this is recommended—but each student must write
their own submission and these cannot be direct copies of each other’s work or be copied from
any other source (e.g., something online). The final exam will be take home and open book.

There is also a final project or final presentation requirement; the final project involves utilizing
one of the topics from the course in your own research while the final presentation would be
teaching the class an econometrics topic not covered in class. Any suspected incidents of cheating
or plagiarism will be recorded with Heinz College administration at the same time the student is
notified.
