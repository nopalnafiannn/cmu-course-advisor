# COURSE DESCRIPTION

Professional Speaking provides practical instruction for preparing and delivering
professional presentations. Activities and assignments include: developing targeted,
strategic messages; structuring content; designing meaningful visuals; working
cohesively in a group presentation; exploring new technologies; and speaking
extemporaneously. Students engage specific audiences using a communication
style (both verbal and nonverbal) suitable for workplace environments. Overall, the
course helps students develop confidence and apply effective techniques when
speaking in a public setting.
# COMMUNICATIONS POLICIES

● Email is my preferred mode of communication and the fastest way to get in
touch with me.
● Please include your name and section number and CC the TA for your
course section in all emails
● Please allow a minimum of 24 hours for me to respond to all emails
● Students are expected to check their CMU emails and Canvas regularly
● I can not discuss grades via email; please come to office hours with questions
pertaining to grades
● If we talk about something before class starts or in the hallway (an extension,
a revision, another project you’d like feedback on), please plan to send me a
follow up email confirming the details.

# COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES

● Identify professional standards in various industries and international
contexts and devise effective, personalized strategies for preparing and
delivering your presentations
● Interpret the needs and expectations of audiences and adapt the content,
organization, and format of your message depending on audience, context,
and purpose
● Design, write, and present logical, cohesive messages using multimodal
approaches as well as standard rhetorical organizational practices (i.e.
introductions, signposts, transitions, recaps)
● Create presentations that conform to professional requirements such as time
constraints, engaging eye contact, adequate volume, clarity in voice
projection, and consistency in pace
● Design and utilize multimodal elements of presentations (i.e. slides,
photographs, posters, tables, charts, diagrams, handouts, audience
participation, videos) in line with workplace expectations and universal design
accessibility standards
● Analyze the implications of visual and non-verbal forms of communication on
professional presence (i.e. professional attire, posture, gestures, facial
expressions) and adapt those forms of communication for different
presentation contexts
● Demonstrate effective collaborative work by planning and delivering a team
presentation
● Prepare and practice evoking audience response, answering questions, and
responding to audience feedback within a wide variety of professional
contexts
● Demonstrate the ability to evaluate presentations and give and receive
specific, productive, constructive feedback as a professional/managerial skill
● Utilize various techniques and technologies to self-evaluate and diagnose
concrete and actionable areas of improvement as a public speaker with a
mind towards consistent professional development
# REGISTRATION

Once a section of Professional Speaking is full, then enrollment is dependent on: (1)
the number of registered students who drop the section, and (2) the waitlist order.

Students who miss the first class meeting can be automatically dropped from the
course. After the initial session, registration is closed. Priority registration may be
given to students for whom Professional Speaking is required.
# OFFICE HOURS POLICIES

Office hours are designated times for students to get one-on-one feedback or ask
questions; you are welcome to drop in to my physical office at any point during
those times. If you would prefer to meet via Zoom during office hours, please let me
know via email.
● If you have a specific topic you want to discuss, feel free to email and
schedule a time in advance. This can include coursework or other speaking
opportunities you would like help on.
● If you are unable to attend my scheduled office hours, we can set up an
appointment at another time, either in person or via Zoom.
● Office hours this semester will be held both in person and via Zoom - please
feel free to utilize the meeting format that fits your comfort level.
● If an emergency arises so you cannot make a scheduled appointment, please
contact me by email as soon as possible.
# ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION POLICIES

In keeping with CMU and Heinz’s expectations and policies, including the In-Person
Expectation (IPE) modality for this course, you are expected to attend all
scheduled classes in person. The expectation from Heinz is that your attendance
for this course will be in the physical classroom during all scheduled class periods. In
the case of inclement weather, the University will post announcements about
school closures, delayed openings, early closings or shifts to online instruction - we
will adjust our course modality based on CMU’s determinations.

However, the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a commitment to
accessibility presents challenges to maintaining any graded attendance policy that
is equitable and based in care and safety. We can not make assumptions about
others’ experiences and as a result, we ought to offer compassion, patience, and
grace to one another as best we can. Therefore, there are options to help students
who may need asynchronous attendance options. It is possible for you to earn all of
the same points by attending class asynchronously; however, given the nature of
public speaking and our active learning classroom, most students will see the most
improvement by attending as many classes in person as possible.

For the purposes of this policy, “attendance” is defined as arriving physically in our
classroom during our regularly scheduled class period. “Participation” covers a
broad range of interactive opportunities, both synchronous and asynchronous, that
demonstrate engagement with the course content. These participation opportunities
include:
● Speaking during class discussions (asking questions, responding to discussion
questions, working in small groups)
● Posting required in-class workshop materials, lightning talks, and homework
assignments to Canvas.
● Providing peer review feedback to classmates during in-class or
asynchronous activities
● Attending office hours (in-person or virtually) with questions, concerns,
thoughts, inspiration, etc.
● Offering constructive feedback to classmates, adding to ongoing discussions,
or practicing additional skills via asynchronous discussion boards on Canvas.

This course focuses on professional development skills; as such, professional
conduct will be expected of all participants. Students should expect to behave as
they would in a staff or client meeting. Students should make a good faith effort to
attend all classes prepared, to interact with peers and the professor on a regular
basis, and to demonstrate respect for all class participants through verbal and
non-verbal modes. Students who engage in abusive or harmful speech will be
immediately excused from class.

Assessment for participation will be a holistic measure of a student’s work on a daily
basis and is based on more than mere presence in the classroom. Active
participation includes engaging in active listening, offering constructive, skills-based
feedback, and adding to class conversation on a daily basis. Students should refrain
from doing other coursework, sleeping, conducting personal business, or other
forms of “multitasking” while in class as much as possible. If you are absent from
class, course materials will be posted on Canvas, but you should also plan to reach
out to a classmate to find out what you missed. Assignments are due on their due
dates regardless of absences, unless a student is specifically issued an extension.

Students who have religious observations, medical/personal emergencies, or other
major difficulties that will result in missed synchronous classes are encouraged to
contact the professor and TA as soon as possible. Students who miss a significant
number of classes may be issued a failing grade or a significant grade
deduction.
### Late Arrival Policy:

Obviously, the occasional emergency can disrupt even the most organized person’s
schedule; however, habitual lateness is considered unprofessional and inconsiderate.

Students who arrive habitually late to class (more than five minutes late and
disrupting Lightning Talks) during the semester may have their grades lowered.
# LEARNING RESOURCES

### Required Texts:

We will use an Open Educational Resource, available freely through the Internet as
our base textbook for the course. The text, Principles of Public Speaking, is available
through the web and can also be downloaded as a PDF. Readings from this text will
be required throughout the semester and will inform class lectures and activities.
### Required Software Platforms:

In order to fully participate in our course, you will be asked to use a few different
online platforms.
## 1. Canvas - Our course will utilize this central Learning Management System

(LMS) as the main technology hub. Students will be granted access to
materials through Canvas and will use the platform to submit formal
assignments. We will also make use of the discussion board for in-class
workshop deliverables and short, low-stakes homework assignments.
## 2. Acclaim - Our course will use this video assessment tool to submit formal

presentation assignments, as well as to provide peer review feedback.
## 3. Zoom - I will utilize Zoom as an online office hour platform in addition to

in-person options. I will also use CMU’s “Zoom in the Room” features to record
our in-person class and post the videos to Canvas, should you miss class.

4. *YouTube* (optional) - Depending on your technology/OS and internet
accessibility, students in the past have found it easier/faster to upload their
presentation videos as an Unlisted YouTube video and submit the link to
Acclaim. Please feel free to choose the option that causes you the least
amount of technical frustration!
### Required Hardware:

## 1. Web camera for recording videos - You will need to record presentations and

upload them to Acclaim/Canvas. You may absolutely use your web camera or
the camera on a smartphone or tablet to accomplish these assignments (this is
NOT a course in video production!)
## 2. Laptop/tablet for classwork: Many of our classes will include active, hands on

practice, either alone or in small groups. Having a laptop or tablet in class is
helpful for completing this work. You should also feel free to take notes or view
the slides on your laptop during class.
## 3. RECOMMENDED: Presentation remote: Many students find having a wireless

option for advancing slides on their computers helpful for formal presentations.

Students may choose to invest in a low-cost option, borrow one from the CMU
library, or install one on their smartphone.

Teaching Assistants
Each section of this course will have a TA. Contact information and office hours will
be posted on Canvas, under the “Pages” tab in the first week of the mini. The TA can
answer questions, respond to issues, direct you to resources, and work through
assignments with you.

Syllabus Modifications
This syllabus – especially the homework and assignment schedule – may be
modified as the semester progresses in order to meet the course outcomes and
best address the needs of members of the class. Pay close attention to course
announcements on Canvas and in class for any of these changes.
# LATE ASSIGNMENTS AND MISSING WORK

# DRAFTS AND PROJECT STAGES

Drafts and project stages are a vital part of the composition process and therefore
a required part of the course. Writing is a process that necessarily takes time; the
project stages of this course are designed to help students focus on improving both
their own personal process as well as final deliverables. As a result, all project stages
must be submitted in a timely fashion; the professor reserves the right to refuse to
accept a final deliverable without the accompanying required project stages.

Students are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED not to use Generative AI on these project
stages; however, if GenAI is used in any capacity, students should note its use as a
footnote on the document, including the tool used, the type of use, and the
reasoning for using it. (For example: I used ChatGPT 4.0 to brainstorm arguments
and supporting evidence in order to expand my logical arguments; the script and
images are all my own creation.)
Extension Policy
Each student has a single extension which they may use on any individual project or
project stage.

This policy excludes elements of the group presentation. If you are experiencing
difficulties during the group project, contact the professor and TA immediately.
### To request an extension, students should:

## 1. Email the professor and TA no later than 24 hours prior to the deadline

indicating your desire to use your extension.
## 2. Provide a new, reasonable date and time for the assignment to be due. If the

assignment is a draft or project stage of a larger project, this date needs to
come before the larger project is due. Due to the nature of the mini, for larger
projects, this new date should usually be within 48 hours of the original due
date.
## 3. This new date/time will be considered the new deadline for the assignment

a. A note will be added to Canvas with this new due date for mutual
reference
b. The student will submit the assignment as instructed on the assignment
sheet
## 4. The student should notify the professor and TA via email indicating the work

has been submitted and is ready for grading.
a. If there is any difficulty submitting the assignment to Canvas, it may
also be appropriate to attach a copy to that email.

Late Assignment Penalties
Ideally, you will avoid turning in late work. Please plan to make use of the extension
policy to avoid these types of issues. In addition to the extension policy outlined
above, this course has a late work policy where assignments may be turned in late
for up to 24 hours with a 20% deduction.

After 24 hours, students will need to schedule an office hours appointment to
discuss circumstances and possible extended due dates. Students may receive a 0
on assignments turned in 24 hours after the deadline.

Missing Work Penalties
Due to the participatory nature of this course, it is important for work to be
completed in a timely manner. In-class discussions and activities are a vital part of
your success in improving your professional communication skills.

I am dedicated to working with students to ensure they have equitable access to the
materials and flexibility to complete the work of the course across a broad range of
experiences. However, work that is missing or is significantly incomplete may not be
eligible to receive points towards the course.

Outside of the course policies and accommodations, students are expected to put
forth a good faith effort to complete the work of the course.
# ACADEMIC CONDUCT

Plagiarism is a serious offense that will result in the student failing the course. All
academic integrity violations will be reported to the associate dean's office for the
student’s program of study and the Carnegie Mellon University Division of Student
Affairs. If an academic integrity violation is suspected, the student will be contacted
to meet with the instructor to determine if a violation has occurred based on
Carnegie Mellon University’s Policy on Academic Integrity. Note that plagiarism
includes:
● Presenting another writer’s work (script, outline, slides, graphics, data
visualizations) as your own (writer in this sense means humans and
computers)
● Cutting and pasting content verbatim without using quotation marks to
indicate a direct quote, or without a verbal citation in your speech;
● Inserting a direct quote or paraphrasing content without citing the source
in-text using footnotes, endnotes, parenthetical citations, linked citations on a
slide, or an oral citation during a speech with a corresponding Works Cited,
## References, or Notes page – in a manner consistent with an APA, MLA, or

Chicago style guide;
● Providing incomplete or incorrect information about the source cited;
● Over-relying on templates or other writers’ phrasing;
● Using someone else’s script, slides, outlines, research or other content for
your own presentations;
● Reusing content from another course
Also, submitting work written for another course is not acceptable. Consequently, a
failing grade may be issued for that assignment. Additional penalties may be
imposed.

A Note about Generative AI
One of the major goals of this course is to help students develop the skills necessary
to continually self-reflect and improve their professional speaking skills. To do this, it
is imperative that students work to develop their own style, voice, and techniques to
organize, write, and revise presentations in their own words and to develop
confidence in presenting that material to various audiences. Students who rely on
shortcuts, especially GenAI produced scripts, tend to perform less well on their
presentations.

In service of these goals, students are strongly urged not to use generative AI for
any graded course assignment. If a student chooses to use GenerativeAI for any
part of the composition process of any assignment, they must document its use with
a footnote and submit the transcript from the GenAI conversation as an appendix to
their assignment. Passing off any generated content as your own (for example:
cutting and pasting content from ChatGPT into your draft script, using CoPilot to
design visuals for your presentation, using an AI translation software like DeepL to
translate entire scripts, etc.) constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you
have questions about using generative AI in this course please talk to me first before
doing so.

# ASSESSMENT

Assignment Instructions
Detailed instructions for all assignments are posted to Canvas. Each student is
responsible for reading the assignment sheet and grade rubric before submitting
the assignment. These instructions will also include assessment criteria for each
assignment.

Students are responsible for submitting their assignments on time and to the correct
(digital) location as directed on the assignment sheet.

Course Grading
Assignments each receive a certain number of points, adding up to 1000 total
points, over the course of the mini. Grades are not curved or weighted beyond these
points.

NOTE: Semester grades are not rounded; in other words, a student who earns
889 points throughout the semester would earn an 88.9% or a B+.

# ASYNCHRONOUS COURSE MAKEUP POLICY

### Absences:

Our course this semester has an in-person meeting expectation – please plan to
attend all of the scheduled classes in person. However, if you are ill or experiencing
an emergency, the course does have an asynchronous makeup option. If you are
sick, especially with symptoms of highly contagious illnesses like COVID-19, RSV,
or the flu, please do not come to class.

To receive full credit for asynchronous attendance and participation for a missed
class, you must complete all of the following steps. Due to the nature of a mini
course, this asynchronous participation is expected to be completed within 48 hours
of the missed class, unless another deadline has been arranged with the professor.

If you are experiencing severe illness or other personal emergencies, please be in
touch with the professor and TA as soon as possible. Your health and safety are our
top priority; we can make accommodations to help you keep up with the
coursework once you are healthy.
### To Make Up a Missed Class:

## 1. Notify the professor and your TA that you will be missing class as soon as

possible. We don’t need details but if you have a sense of how impactful your
illness may be (“I’m likely to miss the next two weeks of classes” versus “I
started taking medicine yesterday and am already feeling better”), we can
help you develop a game plan for making up work/structuring extensions.
## 2. Watch the Zoom recording of class when it is posted on Canvas (usually a

few hours after class).
## 3. Complete your lightning talk on Canvas

## 4. Use the “Asynchronous Discussion Board” on Canvas to post responses to the

in-class discussion (aim to respond to 2-3 discussion questions,) as you would
have if you were in class.
a. In general, the discussion questions are also available on the lecture
slides for the class period, though the in-person discussion sometimes
jumps to other topics or addresses only a few of those questions,
depending on time constraints.
## 5. Use the Canvas Discussion Boards to complete any in-class activities that

your classmates completed during class time (as applicable).
## 6. Notify your course TA when you have completed all of these makeup items in

order to receive attendance and participation credit for the missed class.
a. It is the student’s responsibility to notify the TA when this work is
complete, or that work may not be graded.
