COMMUNICATIONS IN EXTENDED REALITY (XR)
“Comm in XR”
This course explores extended reality (XR) and its transformative potential to change how users communicate
with each other and interact with digital content across various industries. XR is an umbrella term that
encompasses virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). These technologies create
immersive experiences by blending digital and physical worlds using devices such as headsets. VR offers fully
immersive environments, AR overlays digital content onto the real world, and MR merges both realities, allowing
real-time interaction between digital and physical objects.

Over the seven-week session, we will focus on four key areas of XR communication: (1) building professional
relationships through avatar interactions, (2) fostering teamwork and collaboration, (3) evaluating data to inform
sound decision-making and provide actionable recommendations, and (4) delivering effective presentations and
training programs for targeted audiences.

As XR technology evolves, students will act as iterative design partners, developing strategies for effective
communication within diverse virtual environments.
# IMPORTANT INFORMATION

No prior XR experience is needed to participate in this course.

Students are initially placed on a registration waitlist. Enrollment depends on the availability of functional XR
headsets, as each student is provided one for the duration of the course. Additionally, priority registration is
given to students who can participate from home without distractions and additional noise. When used in the
classroom, open microphones on multiple headsets can cause reverberation. At-home participation is preferred, but
not required. The course takes place on Monday and Wednesday at 2:00 pm. If you can participate from home,
please email Prof. Hyatt at hyatt@cmu.edu and ask to be added to the priority registration list.

This course is aligned with Strategic Presentation Skills (SPS) and Public Speaking. It fulfills a communication
requirement (core course) for students at CMU’s Heinz College.

# SEMESTER OVERVIEW

Students create, practice, and deliver presentations, both individually and with group members, using effective
nonverbal, verbal, and visual communication. Examples of assignments include an elevator pitch, an interview, a
group research project and presentation to a (fabricated) client, etc. Some assignments provide options for
differentiation due to a variety of virtual environments and apps (e.g., Master of Arts Management (MAM)
students can host a gallery session, Master of Information Systems (MISM) students can present a new data
visualization tool).

Additionally, each semester delivers content and assignments based on the latest developments in XR technology.

Hardware and software are reviewed a few weeks before each semester to include the latest updates and newest
tech tools.

COURSE OBJECTIVES (according to Bloom’s revised taxonomy)
Students will be able to...

Remember: Identify elements for building professional relationships in XR (e.g., feeling valued, finding common
interests, building an enjoyable school/company culture).

Identify elements for collaborating/fostering teamwork in XR (e.g., creating a shared vision, working
together to solve problems).

Identify effective presentation elements, including message effectiveness (e.g., strong introduction,
smooth transitions, logical flow, closure), verbal skills (e.g., pace, clarity, filler words), and
nonverbal skills (e.g., gestures, eye contact, posture).

Understand: Compare/contrast effective and ineffective presentations based on rubric elements.

Apply: Adapt XR environments for audience members and project goals.

Adapt compelling messages to the perspectives of various stakeholders through written and oral
communications.

Analyze: Analyze XR apps (e.g., Spatial, Engage) to determine the best options for (1) fostering teamwork
and collaboration, (2) presenting to individuals and groups, and (3) sharing data.

Identify strengths and areas for improvement in both individual and peer presentations.

Evaluate: Assess the effectiveness of diverse XR environments for effective communication.

Assess current state of XR technology. For example, avatar facial expressions cannot
effectively evaluate audience engagement.

Provide constructive feedback to peers on their presentations.

Complete self-evaluations to reflect on personal communications and presentations.

Create: Generate best practice strategies for effectively communicating in XR.

Produce effective presentations for a variety of professional contexts, considering the needs
and expectations of specific stakeholders.

Note: We discuss the current limitations of XR technology with regards to nonverbal communication, as well as the
improvements made in recent years.

FEATURED APP: OVATION
# PROFESSIONALISM

As students embark on an exciting semester of professional growth at Heinz College, the importance of
professionalism must be addressed. In the world of academia, as in the professional world, adhering to deadlines
and maintaining high standards are indispensable qualities. Below are a few key reasons why professionalism
matter in this course:
## 1. Accountability: Meeting deadlines establishes accountability for your academic performance. It reflects your

dedication to the subject matter and showcases your ability to manage your time effectively.
## 2. Quality of Work: Adhering to deadlines is conducive to producing high-quality assignments. Rushed or late

submissions often result in subpar work.
## 3. Respect for Others: Submitting work on time demonstrates respect for your peers who rely on shared

contributions for in-class workshops and activities. The act of sharing facilitates efficient and effective
completion of tasks for everyone involved.
## 4. Preparation for the Real World: Cultivating the habit of being punctual for class and submitting work

before deadlines sets the foundation for expectations you'll face in your future career. In a professional
context, tardiness for meetings or late submissions of work can result in missed opportunities, dissatisfied
clients, or even termination of your job.

This semester is an opportunity to develop and practice the essential skills of professionalism that will serve you
well throughout your academic journey and career. Remember that by consistently meeting deadlines and
maintaining high standards, you are setting yourself up for a future filled with success and opportunities.
# REQUIRED TECHNOLOGY

Since each student is assigned a headset for the duration of the course, it becomes their responsibility. The headset
must be returned in working condition and without visible damage or the student will be charged to replace it (see
contract). Students may be required to purchase apps in lieu of a required text.

USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TOOLS
Most assignments encourage the use of AI for content creation and delivery. However, it is imperative that
students verify the accuracy and credibility of the content, references, and evidence before sharing their work.

Conversely, some assignments prohibit the use of AI for content creation and delivery. In these cases, students are
required to demonstrate mastery of course objectives without AI assistance. This ensures that students are wellequipped for their professional careers through impromptu interactions with supervisors, co-workers, and clients.
# ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY

If you plagiarize, you are in violation of academic integrity. An automatic zero is assigned and the incident gets
reported to program administrators. Moreover, if you provide your work to another student and they use it, you
will also be reported for an academic integrity violation.
### ACCOMMODATIONS & OPTIONS FOR DIFFERENTIATION

If a student provides evidence of learning for a specific topic, demonstrating an advanced level of proficiency (see
rubric), a different assignment will be provided. Students are also provided options to complete some of the
assignments in correlation with their field of study or personal interest.
### ATTENDANCE & PARTICIPATION POLICY

CMU Attendance Statement (adapted): To uphold a student’s right to confidentiality, to ensure equitable
treatment, and to protect a faculty member from adjudicating medical needs, the Provost and the Office of
General Counsel strongly encourage faculty to not ask for medical documentation to be provided directly to
them in the case of student absences or late arrivals. To remove ambiguity, some faculty have chosen an
attendance policy with no distinction between excused and unexcused. With this approach, instructors can
make clear that the reason for their attendance policy is to accurately reflect the amount of information that
the student engaged with during class.

Comm in XR is a workshop-based, interactive XR communication course with 10-12 students per section. It’s
not a lecture-based course with exams. Due to this format, attendance, participation, and promptness are factored
into your final grade.

Attendance Policy: If you’re not present, you cannot engage with class activities. Moreover, if you’re late, it is a
distraction to the learning environment when you join class. With daily group interactions and impromptu
speaking exercises in XR, the class relies heavily on active participation for practice sessions and feedback.

Participation Policy: As an interactive class, participation is an expectation (e.g., engaging with speakers by
asking questions, providing feedback after speeches, working productively with group members). Therefore, you
are expected to receive a 0 score. However, you may be awarded additional points for extra effort, or you may
receive negative points for a lack of effort. As a note, these points are completely at the professor's discretion and
based on direct observations during class.

Bonus participation points are awarded if you go above and beyond to…
*  engage with speakers (e.g., asking questions, offering great feedback);
*  engage with group members (e.g., taking a leadership role); and,
*  practice speeches outside of class (e.g., participating in multi-user sessions in Ovation with the TA).

Negative participation points are assigned if you are…
*  not an active listener (e.g., taking off your headset while someone is presenting);
*  not present when class starts (e.g., arriving late is a major distraction in XR environments); and,
*  not prepared when working with your group (e.g., vague outline, incomplete visuals).

DIVERSITY STATEMENT (adapted from https://www.cmu.edu/student-diversity):
Diversity and inclusion have a singular place among the values of Carnegie Mellon University. This class will
“enhance an inclusive and transformative student experience in dimensions such as access, success, and
intergroup dialogue” through class activities, writing workshops, discussions, and assignments.
# GRADING POLICY

A final grade is calculated by combining the points for all assignments and dividing that score by the total number
of points [e.g., 329 (student’s score)/350 (total points) = 94%]. There are no weighted assignments.

Heinz Grading Scale
Grade % Interpretation
### A+ 98 - 100 Exceptional

### A 93 - 97 Excellent

### A‐ 90 - 92 Very Good

### B+ 88 - 89 Good

### B 83 - 87 Acceptable

### B‐ 80 - 82 Fair

### C+ 78 - 79 Poor

### C 73 - 77 Very Poor

### C‐ 70 - 72 Minimal Passing

R 69 - below Failing
I NA Incomplete
# LATE WORK POLICY

Submit assignments to the “Late Work” folder on Canvas. Your work cannot be accepted via email since I utilize
the commenting tools on Canvas to provide feedback. Everyone has an acceptable excuse for late work; therefore,
I cannot give special consideration to some and not others regarding the penalty.

Since I am continuously grading weekly assignments (videos and reflections), I review late work at the end of the
semester, not when you submit the assignment. For major assignments, grading starts at 80% of the total score.

For reflections (only worth 10 points), I cannot accept late work.
# MISSING DRAFTS

A draft, ungraded work, is an important part of the learning process. If a quality draft is not submitted,
-10 points are deducted from your participation score. Without a quality draft, you cannot fully participate with
in-class activities for group work, and there is a penalty for not completing your homework. Drafts are utilized to
provide feedback to a student prior to submitting the work.

NATIONAL COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION (NCA) COMPETENCIES
According to the NCA position on expectations for speaking and listening, “… skills must result in effective
outcomes and seen as appropriate (a) by the audience, (b) in the context enacted, and (c) for the purpose specified.”
See the link on Canvas for NCA Speaking and Listening Competencies for College Students (Basic and Advanced
Skills) that are covered in this course.
# OFFICE HOURS

Office hours are from 8:00 am – 9:30 am or 12:30 pm – 2:00 pm on class days. Afternoon, evening, and
weekend appointments are also available to accommodate a variety of schedules. Please feel free to stop in or
email me to schedule a meeting.

### REGISTRATION & WAITLIST POLICY

Once a section is full, admission to the course is dependent on (1) the number of registered students who drop the
section, and (2) the waitlist order.
# WELLNESS STATEMENT

Wellness (adapted): Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating
well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking time to relax. This will help you
achieve your goals and cope with stress. There are many resources available on campus, and an important part of
the college experience is learning how to ask for help. You are not alone.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings of anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is
available to help you. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty, or family member for help. If you or someone
you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night.
