      "Course Description": "Centered within the intersection of research and futurism, this course is designed in a studio model in which students gain an understanding of how to conduct deep research while considering the changes affecting the artists and organizations of our industries – from emerging technologies to social justice to climate change, geopolitical instability or the growing wealth gap’s impact. This course also teaches how to create digital content – from web sites to podcasts with the assumption that meaningful research produces new ideas that gain greater meaning by being shared. Content creation has become a core activity of both individuals and businesses. Research-driven content is a key component and strategy of most consulting firms, arts organizations, and some artists (eg Jenny O’Dell). Hence, this course provides you with a research-based content creation model focusing on the arts and entertainment enterprises across the globe. Students simultaneously learn and experiment with how to create content using multi-modal, trans-media digital storytelling methods often fueled by AI while learning how to frame and conduct meaningful professional research. Research findings are created with a specific intended audience: followers of Arts Management and Technology, curated by a student-managed team that serves artists and arts professionals working in the field. This class is designed to provide a breadth of skills that will serve emerging professionals. With a focus on digital modes of research and communication, young professionals leave the course with effective skills to communicate evidence-supported ideas to peers, supervisors, or customers. Furthermore, current and future leaders need to understand how to evaluate or conduct research using the most effective and efficient tools in order to address emerging opportunities. Adopting a studio model, students will spend time outside of class time gaining an understanding of critical and practical tools for research and digital publication. In class, students will work actively to synthesize this work, from creating an evidenced-based infographic to scripting and recording a podcast episode. Each student will be working on an independent project with the arts at the core. A list of potential, but not prescribed research topics are provided at the beginning of the semester and all assignments scaffold from inception to final digital products.",

      "Course Description": "We have entered the era of Generative AI, which holds transformational potential akin to the industrial revolution or the advent of the Internet. This technology is now capable of comprehending and generating language, code, images, and videos, performing routine digital tasks, and aiding humans in advancing scientific and creative fields. These intelligent capabilities are powering novel AI user experiences such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Dall-E, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot and various proprietary and open-source offerings. These innovations can boost human productivity and creativity, but their impact on society will be somewhat unpredictable long-term. By immersing ourselves in the study of Generative AI, we not only equip ourselves for personal growth but also become architects of a future where technology serves humanity’s highest aspirations. In this course, students will explore the broad impacts of generative AI by considering its applications, societal implications, and governance. We will explore how leveraging AI tools can help us as individuals thrive in our personal and professional lives. We will learn how both governments and private enterprises are seeking to develop beneficial and safe AI aligned with human needs. This course will provide students with practical exposure to the latest AI technologies. Students will learn the art of prompt engineering, how to use AI as a research, writing and thinking tool, and strategies to avoid common AI failure points. The first part of the course will cover how generative AI is created and applied, including the potential for it to augment human capabilities in beneficial ways. This includes a host of in-class activities using Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT and other AI tools. This will include workshops on researching and writing with the help of AI. The second part of the course will cover societal implications and governance, including public policy. Issues we will cover include: Economic and labor impact, Information and ecosystem impact, Data ownership impact. Class sessions and assignments will involve hands-on AI activities, including the creation of audio and video “deepfakes” and “red teaming” of models. We will host in-class discussion groups that dissect AI public policy debates across the US, EU and international realms. Additionally, we will explore techniques for responsible AI development and release at organizations.",

        "Plagiarism Definition": "Plagiarism is the failure to indicate the source of work either with quotation marks or footnotes. The source can be a phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific language, or an idea derived from the work of another person. Note that material on the web is another person’s work and is therefore equally subject to the rules on plagiarism and cheating as any other source material.",
        "Consequences of Plagiarism": "Plagiarism and/or cheating on an essay assignment will result in a failing grade (0 points) for that assignment. The essay in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the offending student’s assignments included in grade calculations; the points for that essay zero (0) will be factored into the grade. Furthermore, the cheating student’s final grade will be reduced one full letter grade. A cheating student’s final grade will be impacted significantly. In addition, cases of cheating and plagiarism will be submitted to and reviewed by the Dean’s Office; more severe penalties may be imposed, up to and including expulsion from the Heinz School."

Its objective is to provide individuals who aspire to enter management or policy analysis positions with the basic statistical tools for analyzing and interpreting data. For students intending to take more advanced courses in statistics and machine learning its purpose is also to ensure that you are well grounded in the fundamentals of statistics. The course is divided into three distinct modules: descriptive statistics, statistical inference, and regression analysis. The emphasis of the lectures on descriptive statistics is the calculation and interpretation of summary statistical measures and graphical methods for describing raw data. The sessions on statistical inference are designed to provide you with the background for executing and interpreting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. The final component of the course focuses on regression analysis, a widely used statistical methodology. Throughout the course you will regularly analyze data relevant to management and policy analysis using a statistical platform developed here at CMU called ISLE.\",\n    \"Instructors\": {\n      \"Eli Ben-Michael\": {\n        \"Email\": \"ebenmichael@cmu.edu\",\n        \"Office hours\": \"10am – 11am Monday and 2pm – 3pm Tuesday.

      ]
    },
    "REGISTRATION": "Once a section of Professional Speaking is full, then enrollment is dependent on: (1) the number of registered students who drop the section, and (2) the waitlist order. Students who miss the first class meeting can be automatically dropped from the course. After the initial session, registration is closed. Priority registration may be given to students for whom Professional Speaking is required.",
    "OFFICE HOURS POLICIES": {
      "Policies": [
        "Office hours are designated times for students to get one-on-one feedback or ask questions; you are welcome to drop in to my physical office at any point during those times. If you would prefer to meet via Zoom during office hours, please let me know via email.",
        "If you have a specific topic you want to discuss, feel free to email and schedule a time in advance. This can include course work or other speaking opportunities you would like help on.",
        "If you are unable to attend my scheduled office hours, we can set up an appointment at another time, either in person or via Zoom.",
        "Office hours this semester will be held both in person and via Zoom - please feel free to utilize the meeting format that fits your comfort level.",

    },
    "ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION POLICIES": {
      "Policy": "In keeping with CMU and Heinz’s expectations and policies, including the In-Person Expectation (IPE) modality for this course, you are expected to attend all scheduled classes. The expectation from Heinz is that your attendance for this course will be in the physical classroom during all scheduled class periods. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as a commitment to accessibility presents challenges to maintaining any graded attendance policy that is equitable and based in care and safety. As your professor, I recognize and acknowledge that many of our lives may be unaffected by world events, while others will experience profound tragedies. We cannot make assumptions about others’ experiences and as a result, we ought to offer compassion, patience, and grace to one another as best we can. Therefore, there are options to help students who may need asynchronous attendance options. It is possible for you to earn all of the same points by attending class asynchronously; however, given the nature of public speaking and our active learning classroom, most students will see the most improvement by attending as many classes in person as possible."
    },
    "Late Arrival Policy": "Obviously, the occasional emergency can disrupt even the most organized person’s schedule; however, habitual lateness is considered unprofessional and inconsiderate. Students who arrive habitually late to class (more than five minutes late and disrupting Lightning Talks) during the semester may have their grades lowered.",
    "LEARNING RESOURCES": {
      "Required Texts": "We will use an Open Educational Resource, available freely through the Internet as our base textbook for the course. The text, Principles of Public Speaking, is available through the web and can also be downloaded as a PDF.

        },
        {
          "Platform": "Flip (formerly FlipGrid)",
          "Description": "Our course will use this video discussion board platform to record and upload short, informal homework assignments designed to help students practice public speaking skills in a low stakes environment, asynchronous opportunities for participation/make-up discussions, as well as make ups for missed Lightning Talks. A low-stakes practice space is also available for students seeking to improve their skills beyond the requirements of the course."
        },
        {
          "Platform": "Zoom",
          "Description": "I will utilize Zoom for online office hours. I will also use CMU’s “Zoom in the Room” features to record our in-person class."

          "Platform": "YouTube (optional)",
          "Description": "Depending on your technology/OS and internet accessibility, students in the past have found it easier/faster to upload their presentation videos as an Unlisted YouTube video and submit the link to Acclaim. Please feel free to choose the option that causes you the least amount of technical frustration!"

      ],
      "Required Hardware": [
        "Laptop/tablet for classwork: Many of our classes will include active, hands-on practice, either alone or in small groups. Having a laptop or tablet in class is helpful for completing this work. You should also feel free to take notes or view the slides on your laptop during class.",
        "Web camera for recording videos - You will need to record presentations and upload them to Acclaim/Flip. You may absolutely use your web camera or the camera on a smart phone or tablet to accomplish these assignments (this is NOT a course in video production!)"

There is also a Canvas app that provides notifications regarding the course.",
      "CLASS ATTENDANCE": "Attendance at classes is critical for successful completion of the course. Students will be expected to watch prerecorded lectures and download relevant course materials from Canvas prior to class. The professor frequently provides verbal explanations, clarification and instructions regarding concepts, assignments, and course deliverables during class time. Examples of project plans may also be reviewed and discussed during class. It is assumed that students will attend every class in its entirety and take notes in order to ensure that they do not miss this essential part of the course. Since students will be expected to view lectures outside of course time, there will be fewer required in-class sessions as noted on the syllabus.",
      "MICROSOFT PROJECT TUTORIAL": "By the end of this course, students are expected to have acquired basic skills with Microsoft Project, a commonly used project management software product employed in many industries. A tutorial will be held either during class or asynchronously.",

      "ETHICAL STANDARDS": "Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards with respect to plagiarism and cheating. Neither plagiarism nor cheating will be tolerated on any exercises, quizzes, exams or assignments. Students may collaborate with others only when expressly permitted by the instructor. Students who violate academic standards will at a minimum receive a failing grade for the assignment and may also receive a failing grade for the course. Such cases will be referred to the Associate Dean, who may decide to take further action.",
      "STUDENTS MAY NOT USE GENERATIVE AI IN ANY FORM": "To best support your own learning, you should complete all graded assignments in this course yourself, without any use of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Please refrain from using AI tools to generate any content (text, video, audio, images, code, etc.) for an assignment or classroom exercise. Passing off any AI generated content as your own (e.g., cutting and pasting content into written assignments, or paraphrasing AI content) constitutes a violation of CMU’s academic integrity policy. If you have any questions about using generative AI in this course please email or talk to me.",

All other questions regarding the course or assignments should be posted to the Canvas discussion board. In this way, all students will be able to review answers to other questions. All students are required to monitor the discussion board on a frequent basis to ensure that they have up to date information since the board is also used to post clarifications regarding the assignments. It is suggested that each student subscribe to each of the seven threads to be notified of posts. The instructor and the TAs will be checking the discussion board Monday-Friday and occasionally on weekends. Please note that questions received via email or phone, and last minute questions regarding an assignment will not be answered. Personal questions regarding the course should be directed to the instructor.",
      "USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES": "Laptops, tablets, cell phones and other electronic devices are not permitted in class. There are two reasons for this: Research on learning shows that unexpected noises and movement automatically divert and capture people's attention, which means you are affecting everyone’s learning experience if your cell phone, laptop, etc. makes noise or is visually distracting during class. The use of electronic devices in past sections of Project Management has demonstrated that they are too distracting for students and can have an adverse effect on class performance. There will be specific days when students will be working on assignments during class sessions, and there will be advance notice that laptops would be permitted on those days.",
      "RECORDING OF CLASS SESSIONS": "No student may record or tape any classroom activity without the express written consent of the instructor. If a student believes that he/she is disabled and needs to record or tape classroom activities, he/she should contact the Office of Equal Opportunity Services, Disability Resources to request an appropriate accommodation. For this course, I will be recording class sessions and making them available to you after classes for your personal, educational use. Recordings of class sessions are covered under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and must not be shared with anyone outside your course-section. The purpose of these recordings is so students in this course (and only students in this course) can watch or re-watch past class sessions. The recordings are not a substitute for coming to class (you won’t be able to join class remotely), and they will only become available after that day’s class sections are finished. Feel free to use the recordings if you would like to review something we discussed in class or if you are temporarily unable to attend class.",

Assignments include crafting persuasive employment correspondence, responding to emails with professional etiquette, and developing impactful business proposals, memos, and performance evaluations. Since writing is a cumulative skill, interactive workshops provide an opportunity for participants to share insights and collectively refine their work.

          "4. Preparation for the Real World": "Cultivating the habit of being punctual for class and submitting work before deadlines sets the foundation for expectations you'll face in your future career.

Approximately half of each class session will be spent describing local, state, and federal housing policies and discussing the implications (both positive and negative) of these policies in urban settings. The students will read two books to be used as aids for class discussion. The books are The Color of Law by Richard Rothstein and Evicted by Matthew Desmond. Additionally, there may be one or two occasions where a guest speaker presents a specific policy issue. The remaining half of each class session will be spent learning the financial computations used by practitioners of housing development. In other words, how are new affordable housing developments financed when the developer knows that the rents will be less than what he/she could receive on the private market? The course will cover the basic principles of both market-rate and affordable housing finance. The instructor will also teach the fundamentals of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. By the end of the course, the students will be expected to know how to calculate Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and use them to generate equity in affordable housing developments. The course is for students who may want to work for local, state, and/or the federal government directly impacting issues related to affordable housing. This course is also for students who would like to work for an affordable housing developer, a real estate practitioner, and/or is just interested in the topic of affordable housing.

      "content": "Consumer Analytics is a growing field that spans industry boundaries, but is rapidly evolving within the health care industry. This class delves into the parallel world of consumer analytics as it pertains to personalization and digital marketing as opposed to the separate domain of clinical analytics and bioinformatics. Patient utilization history and claims data are being used to drive wellness health programs, website search histories are used to understand patient behavior better and give recommendations at the right time. Healthcare consumers now have more access to information - many companies are engaged in direct-to-consumer marketing, patients can look up quality outcomes for their provider, and medication instructional videos are now on YouTube. Held on weekends for 8 hours per day, this micro mini course will highlight the data sources and insights used by providers, payers and tech companies to understand and influence consumer behavior. Students will gain insight into the ML algorithms such as recommendation engines, marketing analytics, personalization and explore specific use cases alongside industry experts. Topics will also include evaluation of such technologies and privacy and ethical implications of collecting and utilizing health data. This is an introductory course on US healthcare data and applications of consumer (i.e. non clinical) analytics. This course will help lay the foundation of your healthcare data journey and provide you with the knowledge and skills necessary to work in the healthcare industry as a data analyst/scientist. Healthcare is unique because it is associated with continually evolving and complex processes associated with health management and medical care. We'll learn about the many facets to consider in the US healthcare system and have case study discussions with industry experts along the way. We’ll discuss the various types of healthcare data and assess the complexity that occurs as you work with pulling in all the different types of data to aid in decisions. We'll cover different categories of healthcare data and describe the terminology / standards to organize it to facilitate computation. We'll discuss the common clinical representations of data in healthcare systems, including ICD-10, SNOMED, LOINC, drug vocabularies (e.g., RxNorm), and clinical data standards. Students will familiarize themselves with the role of ethics in healthcare analyses and HIPAA Privacy - and unintended consequences of analytics and discuss the framework to consider the implications. We’ll cover the developing trends via disruptive technologies and new data sources and applications. We’ll discuss case studies with industry leaders and experts. We’ll cover the common ML algorithms used in consumer analytics in healthcare and how to evaluate them",

According to the Recording Industry Association of America, music revenues in 2016 were the highest they’ve been in over eight years with the largest year-over-year percentage increase in over 18 years. However, these numbers do not reflect the tumultuous waters in which those connected to the music industry find themselves today. While streaming services have increased accessibility, the issues of piracy and artist control are of grave concern. This course will examine how the record labels and publishers are responding to the changing economy of the music industry. Discussions will address the big players in the music industry (Sony Music, Universal Music, Warner Music Group, Sony Publishing, & UMPG) as well as indie record labels’ business strategy, how legal aspects of the music industry effect artists, publishers, and consumers (digital rights management, etc.), as well as the ever-increasing reliance on streaming and the technical companies providing music services. Topics to be examined include copyright law, label and publishing agreements with artists, and backend monetization of assets"

        "Description": "Artificial Intelligence or AI is the science of making machines smart. Generative Artificial Intelligence is an AI system that responds to prompts to create new content including images, text, storytelling, music, video, and film. Based on Natural Language Processing models and utilizing neural networks, it can generate these different media formats by identifying patterns and structures within existing data. It is a probabilistic tool. The use of such Large Language Models and machine learning techniques is a game changer in the entertainment industry. This course introduces the use of AI tools specific to the media business and an overview of related moral complexities that you may face as a working professional in the entertainment industry. We will examine the issues that often arise within an industry that places corporate profits and artistic freedom above all else. Through practical application as well as class discussion, we will highlight how AI is transforming the entertainment industry. In particular, the course will address how quickly AI is disrupting traditional business models, intellectual property rights, and studio production as well as creating tension between creative artists, executives, talent, trade unions, agencies, and audiences.",

For policy makers, the ability to tell the right story using data can make the difference between a successful initiative and one that fails. Part art, part science, visualizing data is a process that is both well established in existing disciplines and experimental and rapidly changing in others. In this course we’ll explore both ends of the spectrum as we deconstruct and reconstruct data visualizations behind some of the world’s most powerful brands, dig into our own data in compelling ways to help our readers understand complex issues, and finally experiment with new ways to represent data about our work, our community, and even ourselves. This course will provide hands-on training and experimentation with a number of tools, and students will have some flexibility to concentrate on mediums that best match their desired outcomes for a final project deliverable (print, digital, interactive or immersive). By the end of this course, students will have an introduction to a number of different tools and techniques that will allow them to immediately start applying what they’ve learned to both other coursework as well as on-the-job needs.\",\n      \"Prerequisites\": \"This course is designed as a graduate-level experience for students that have at least basic computer proficiency and writing skills. Since we'll be creating digital artifacts in this course including publicly-available websites, you should feel at least somewhat comfortable writing narrative-driven stories, reports, and the results of data analysis. Likewise, you should be at least somewhat familiar with correctly citing source materials used, the basics of paraphrasing, and applications of U.S. copyright law to images and written content. See the excellent library guide at https://guides.library.cmu.edu/usingimages for more. If you have questions about what I mean by all of this, please ask! Since we work with data in this course, you should also feel comfortable working with spreadsheets, an present a willingness to learn something slightly outside of your comfort zone.

      "Course Description": "This is an introductory course in data analysis and statistical inference. Its objective is to provide individuals who aspire to enter management or policy analysis positions with the basic statistical tools for analyzing and interpreting data. For students intending to take more advanced courses in statistics and machine learning its purpose is also to ensure that you are well grounded in the fundamentals of statistics. The course is divided into three distinct modules: descriptive statistics, statistical inference, and regression analysis. The emphasis of the lectures on descriptive statistics is the calculation and interpretation of summary statistical measures and graphical methods for describing raw data. The sessions on statistical inference are designed to provide you with the background for executing and interpreting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. The final component of the course focuses on regression analysis, a widely used statistical methodology. Throughout the course you will regularly analyze data relevant to management and policy analysis using a statistical platform developed here at CMU called ISLE.",

If you do not use this absence, 5 extra points will be added to your lowest homework score when computing your final grade (i.e., extra credit). This will be the only option for extra credit within the course. If there are extenuating circumstances that require you to miss class repeatedly or for an extended period, or without prior notice, please discuss the issue with me so that I can assist in connecting you with the appropriate support, and/or review assignments given during that class session. Because we will devote some class time to discussion around assignments, it is important to note that we will be less concerned with finding an “answer” during the discussion, but rather we will be hoping to engage in thoughtful conversation."

      "Accommodations for Students with Disabilities": "If you have a disability and are registered with the Office of Disability Resources, please use their online system to notify the instructor of your accommodations and make arrangements to discuss your needs with the instructor as early in the course as possible. The instructor will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, please contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu",
      "Intellectual and Professional Integrity": "Students at Carnegie Mellon University are engaged in preparing for professional activity of the highest standards, including the highest standards of ethics and integrity. You are expected to have read and understood the Student Handbook and to conduct yourself in a professional manner both inside and outside the classroom, particularly as representatives of this course, the Master of Arts Management Program, Heinz College, and Carnegie Mellon University. Misrepresentation of another’s work as your own (e.g. plagiarism and cheating) is widely recognized as a very serious matter. Cases of cheating and plagiarism are viewed by the University as extremely serious. Students found to have cheated or plagiarized on an assignment will receive a zero on the assignment and information about the offense will be submitted to the Dean’s office for review. Severe penalties may be imposed, up to and including expulsion.",
      "Late / Make Up Work": "Due dates for every assignment are provided on the course syllabus and in Canvas. Unless otherwise stated, assignments are due on those days. However, recognizing that sometimes things happen, you will be allotted one assignment that can be turned in late – up to two days – without penalty. For anything turned in late beyond the one allowance without penalty, 5 points will be deducted from your score on that assignment.",
      "Recordings": "Students are allowed to record class sessions only with the instructor’s permission. Permitted recordings are only for your personal use. Distribution of any recording is prohibited. This is to protect your FERPA rights and those of your fellow colleagues.",
      "Statement for Support for Students’ Health and Well-Being": "Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, you are strongly encouraged to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call # 412-268-2922 and visit http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/",
      "Technology": "This class will involve the occasional use of technology (laptops, tablets and phones) during class. Please keep your technology tools charged and nearby for use when designated by the instructor. Having access to portable headphones with a microphone is also recommended. Research has shown that divided attention is detrimental to learning, so please minimize distractions by turning off device notifications and limiting open windows to related class work (for example: use of a Google doc to collaboratively take notes when working with a group). All personal matters requiring email, messaging, texts, other homework, etc. must be handled outside of class."

Attendance and Participation: Real estate development professionals actively engage in creative and technical discussion with a myriad of stakeholders and professionals daily. This personal interaction is critical to the real development process. Interaction among students, me, and guest speakers are valuable elements of the learning experience for this class. Therefore, attendance and participation are worth 20% of the total grade; each unexcused absence will result in a deduction of 5% of your overall grade. Participating means that you will: Attend class. Arrive to class on time. Engage thoughtfully in class discussions. Lead (with a small group) at least one 20-30 minute class discussion on a real estate development issue reported in the public press. In the case of special circumstances -- such as a doctor excused illness, observation of a religious holiday, or personal emergency- an absence will be excused. Please make every effort to be on time for class. A pattern of unexcused tardiness (more than one) may negatively affect your overall assessment.

The timestamp given by Canvas will be the determining factor if the assignment is late or not. One second past the due date is still late! I suggest giving yourself enough time to log into Canvas and submit. If there are any issues, feel free to email the assignment to the instructors, in which case the email timestamp will be used. You have unlimited attempts to re-submit updated copies of your assignments in Canvas until the due date/time, and I will only consider the most recent, on-time submission for grading.",

CMU and your instructors are committed to your success and to supporting Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended and the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990). This means that in general no individual who is otherwise qualified shall be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity, solely by reason of having a disability. If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact us ASAP, and we will work together to ensure that you have the correct access to resources on campus to assist you through your coursework and time at CMU.",
      "Academic Integrity": "Carnegie Mellon University sets high standards for academic integrity. Those standards are supported and enforced by students, including those who serve as academic integrity hearing panel members and hearing officers. The presumptive sanction for a first offense is course failure, accompanied by the transcript notation “Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.” The standard sanction for a first offense by graduate students is suspension or expulsion. Please see https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academicintegrity.html for any questions. The instructors of this course have a strong aversion to cheating of any kind and will hold no reservations enforcing CMU’s strict academic policy. As the course name suggests, ethics are important to penetration testing and must also be displayed in the classroom as well.",
      "Cell Phones, Smartphones and other handheld wireless devices": "Other than during class breaks, please silence ring tones and refrain from engaging in calls, messaging or other use during class time. All devices must not be visible in any way during quizzes.",
      "Policy Regarding Students Using English as a Foreign Language": "Assignments in this course are graded with reference to evidence of the acquisition of concepts, presentation format, and accuracy of information. Having done business in countries that use languages other than English, we understand that the use of an unfamiliar language can result in unusual word choices or grammatical errors that are not critical to the overall understanding of the information. Therefore, we will take into account your need to function in a language that may be unfamiliar to you. We will provide feedback as appropriate if we feel that language or grammar you have used in assignments would be best if it were configured in a different way.",
      "Use of CMU Canvas System for this course": "The Heinz Colelge uses Carnegie Mellon University’s Canvas system to facilitate distance learning as well as to enhance main campus courses. In this course, we will use the Canvas system generally to post lecture notes and related documents and to receive assignments electronically from students. We welcome feedback during and after the course. Students are encouraged to share lifeexperiences in class. We are open to suggestions about class sequences, changes to the content and additional topics to cover."

        "text": "Businesses must compete in new ways for growth and relevancy, driven by the accelerated rate of digital innovation and inherent market complexity. As a result, organizations have become reliant upon an ability of their people and leaders to embrace continuous change for strategic gain while delivering continuous, incremental value to customers. No longer is it good enough to pursue internal efficiencies alone, rather organizations are challenged to become more effective in product and service delivery through customer demand for high involvement (and customization.) Companies in all industries seek to navigate their growing complexity using empirical process control, realizing predictive measures of cause and effect are not possible in much of the knowledge work we must engage in. This reality explains why industries are making the shift to leverage lightweight organizational frameworks and agile methods that replace traditional approaches only suited for simple and complicated domains. In this course we learn the history of agile methods, we explore Kanban, DevOps and, more deeply, the Scrum Framework, as it is the most popular around the globe, and sits at the root of most every enterprise framework used to “scale agility.”",

        "text": "High paying, strategic jobs of Product Owner and Scrum Master top the high-pay job boards and are in high demand from all the major players and Fortune companies. Many students will find themselves becoming part of co-creative, cross-functional teams for strategic corporate initiatives. Many are in pursuit of playing strategic Product Owner and Scrum Master roles, as well as supporting roles in Product management, development and delivery - if this is you, this is a course you really must consider - speak to your student network about the value this course will bring to your career goals. Agile Methods is the perfect course for entrepreneurially-minded professionals having career aspirations within any departmental functions (such as Product Management, Product Development, Human Resources, Sales & Marketing, Finance, Supply Chain, etc.), and for those wanting to learn through practical application just how organizations deliver continuous value and lead continuous change."

Your team will also be responsible to build and deliver the desired product, turning product backlog into reality. Up to 5 points are earned by each team, each week starting week 2. Points will be earned by your team progressing through our backlog of learning objective(s) with quality: Demonstrable teamwork during class, Quality work-product and deliverables, Critical Thinking as demonstrated in the level of questions being asked on the journey, Operate as a team outside of class to apply what has been learned as a means to “learn by doing”. 30 Improving points: Living out our culture of Continuous Improvement means we are demonstrably committed to offering one another productive, growth-oriented feedback as a strategic mean for professionals building world-class products. Up to 5 points are earned by each team, each week starting week 2. During Sprint Review in class: An assigned “stakeholder team” will provide effective feedback to your team user feedback on the product you are building during Sprint Reviews we host in class, where your product owner and team must prove to be effective in engaging your stakeholders, and being effective in dealing with this feedback offered. Visualized in the Product Backlog, and ultimately (if applicable) finding its way into your final product if the business justification is there in the eyes of the Product Owner. During Sprint Retrospective in class: Each week your team will host a team Sprint Retrospective, where your team will visualize improvement opportunities, collaborate as a team to determine one strategic improvement to the way your team is working and assessing the impact of prior improvement efforts. Moreso, visualizing in your Sprint Backlog, the improvement you are undertaking each Sprint."

      "Professor": "Rubab Jafry O’Connor",
      "Course Description": "This introductory course (there are no prerequisite courses) is designed to improve your effec8veness as an individual, manager and leader by introducing you to frameworks for understanding organiza8ons, organiza8onal processes, and necessary skills. Organiza8ons have been studied from the perspec8ve of several social science disciplines, including psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology, and poli8cal science. The field on which this course is based, organiza8onal behavior, draws from all these disciplines and applies the insights derived from the per8nent research. This course will introduce you to this research and offer ways to apply this knowledge situa8onally through analysis and subsequent class discussion of case studies. While building the collec8ve technical and quan8ta8ve skills of an organiza8on is important, the human skills of managing, organizing, and communica8ng are arguably even more so. The reality is that people, not quan8ta8ve and technical skills, are the backbone of any organiza8on. And yet, this self-evident fact con8nues to get overlooked as we presume our own level of competence in this area. Unfortunately, we tend to overes8mate our human skills and engage our colleagues in unsystema8c and unreflec8ve ways. This course is designed to get you thinking more mindfully about how we engage others in our professional environments. At 8mes we will manage others and at 8mes we will be managed by others. We will always be working with others. As we progress through the course, we will explore various human elements of organiza8ons and think about ways in which we can op8mize performance using what we’ve learned. The course will provide you with opportuni8es to develop and prac8ce your interpersonal and leadership skills within a team context while also providing you with an opportunity to reflect and share. Throughout the course, we will cover several topics including organiza8onal culture, organiza8onal structure, team dynamics, communica8on, leadership, social networks, decision making, strategy, diversity and inclusion, interpersonal rela8onships, personali8es and individual differences, and more.",

        "Attendance, Participation & Engagement": {
          "Details": "Each student begins the semester with 50 points (A, P, & E Score). Points are added or subtracted from A, P, & E Score according to the following: 0-10 points are added for class par8cipa8on as evaluated over the course of the semester by the professor. Everyone is encouraged and expected to par8cipate in class discussions and ac8vi8es. Sharing your own knowledge and experience benefits the en8re class. Construc8ve contribu8on to the class discussion and genuine listening to others is an important element of class par8cipa8on. Keep in mind that high quality par8cipa8on is the goal, not high quan8ty of air8me. In other words, it's not how much you talk, it's what you say that's important. AUendance is taken in all classes, including the first class. If you are absent from class, 3 points may be deducted from your par8cipa8on score. If you need to miss a class, please e-mail me with as much advance no8ce as possible and state the reason for missing class. If it is a valid reason for missing class, this is an ‘excused absence’ and 3 points will not be deducted. If it is not a valid reason for missing class – for example, you slept in or were on vaca8on – this is an ‘unexcused absence’ and 3 points will be deducted. There is a penalty for excessive absences. If you miss three classes (including both excused and unexcused absences), 30 points will be deducted from your final course grade. If you miss four classes, 45 points will be deducted from your final course grade. If you miss five or more classes, 60 points will be deducted from your final course grade. If you are more than a few minutes late arriving to a class, two points will be deducted from your class par8cipa8on score. Lastly, technology (phone, computer, ear buds, etc) unless instructed are not allowed in the class. Please read the sec8ons on 'Learn in Class' and 'Mobile Devices' to understand why not. Anyone using the technology in class will lose 5 points from the par8cipa8on score. The quality of ODI course depends on your engagement, par4cipa4on, and desire to learn. Bring energy and enthusiasm to the class so we can have a robust experience."
        }
      },
      "Written Assignments": "You are required to complete five individual wriUen assignments. Please refer to the 'Assignments' sec8on on Canvas.",
      "Feedback Mechanism": "The way ODI is designed, students engage in several hands-on ac8vi8es and feedback is embedded in the class ac8vi8es and lectures. Pay aUen8on specially to lectures and ac8vi8es wrap-up. The instructor will also provide construc8ve feedback to each student and project groups from 8me to 8me. The feedback will cover topics including, but not limited to, class par8cipa8on, reflec8on entries. self-assessment, project progress, check-ins, etc. Addi8onally, students are highly encouraged to stop by her office during her office hours to have informal conversa8ons.",
      "Mobile Devices": {
        "Policy": "As research on learning shows, unexpected noises and movement automa8cally divert and capture people's aUen8on, which means you are affec8ng everyone’s learning experience if your cell phone, pager, laptop, etc. makes noise or is visually distrac8ng during class. For this reason, I ask you to turn off your mobile devices and laptops. Here is an interes8ng study on how the use of smartphones reduces available cogni8ve capacity. hUps://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/691462Links to an external site."

      "Respect for Diversity": "It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspec8ves be well served by this course. While diversity may recall familiar subdivisions such as race, color, na8onal origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orienta8on, and the like, I would also encourage you to think in terms of things like work styles, communica8on styles, skills, and abili8es. Respect and apprecia8on for the variety of talents, styles and approaches will be a major theme in this course. When we find ourselves in disagreements in the classroom or in our project groups, let us pledge to seUle our disagreements in good faith by trea8ng each other with the utmost respect and truly listening to one another with intent to understand.",
      "Accommodations for Students with Disabilities": "If you have a disability and require accommoda8ons, please contact Catherine Getchell, Director of Disability Resources, 412-268-6121, getchell@cmu.edu.

      "Academic Integrity": "Honesty and transparency are important features of good scholarship. On the flip side, plagiarism and chea8ng are serious academic offenses with serious consequences. If you are discovered to be engaging in either behavior in this course, you will earn a failing grade on the assignment in ques8on, and further disciplinary ac8on may be taken.

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by ea8ng well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, geNng enough sleep, and taking some 8me to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during 8mes of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful.

      "COURSE DESCRIPTION": "Communication in written form is an essential element of management. Writing for business-focused, industry-specific contexts differs from academic writing. Accordingly, this course focuses on teaching transferable, career-enhancing writing skills: developing essential and persuasive content, applying logic, organizing information, targeting diverse audiences with varying levels of expertise and roles, addressing feasibility, ensuring clarity, controlling tone, maintaining format norms, and designing documents for readability and accessibility. The course challenges students to meet readers’ needs by conveying critical thinking via anticipating the perspectives of stakeholders in professional situations.

      },
      "SYLLABUS MODIFICATIONS": "This syllabus – especially the homework and assignment schedule – may be modified as the semester progresses in order to meet the course outcomes and best address the needs of members of the class. Pay close attention to course announcements posted on Canvas and made in class for any of these changes which may alter our modality or course delivery options.",
      "TEACHING ASSISTANTS": "Each section of this course will have a TA. Contact information and office hours will be posted on Canvas, under the “Pages” tab in the first week of the mini. The TA can answer questions, respond to issues, direct you to resources, and work through assignments with you.",
      "COMMUNICATION POLICIES": [
        "Email is my preferred mode of communication and the fastest way to get in touch with me.",
        "The Canvas messaging system is not as reliable and should be avoided.",
        "Please include your name and section number and CC the TA for your course section in all emails",

        "If we talk about something before class starts or in the hallway (an extension, a revision, another project you’d like feedback on), please plan to send me a follow up email confirming the details."
      ],
      "OFFICE HOURS POLICIES": "Every week, I set aside office hours or a reserved block of time to meet with students. This is the ideal time for students to get one-on-one feedback, ask questions, or discuss concerns. You are welcome to drop in to my office during office hours or, if you have a specific topic you want to discuss (or a tight schedule), feel free to email to make a specific appointment. I am happy to meet in person or via Zoom.",
      "ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION POLICY": "In keeping with CMU and Heinz’s expectations and policies, you are expected to attend all scheduled classes. The expectation from Heinz is that you will attend every class in-person in our designated classroom. However, a commitment to accessibility, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, presents challenges to maintaining any graded attendance policy that is equitable and based in care and safety. As your professor, I recognize and acknowledge that we can not make assumptions about others’ experiences and as a result, we ought to offer compassion, patience, and grace to one another as best we can. Therefore, there are options available to help students who may need occasional asynchronous attendance options (i.e. family emergencies, illness).",
      "LATE ARRIVAL POLICY": "Obviously, the occasional emergency can disrupt even the most organized person’s schedule; however, habitual lateness is considered unprofessional and inconsiderate. Students who arrive habitually late to class (more than five minutes late) during the semester may have their grades lowered. If circumstances will hinder your ability to arrive on time regularly, please speak with the professor to discuss arrangements.",
      "DRAFTS AND PROJECT STAGES": "Drafts and project stages are a vital part of the writing process and therefore a required part of the course. Writing is a process that necessarily takes time; the project stages of this course are designed to help students focus on improving both their own personal process as well as final deliverables. As a result, all project stages must be submitted in a timely fashion; the professor reserves the right to refuse to accept a final deliverable without the accompanying required project stages. Project stages can not be completed and submitted for credit after the project is submitted (i.e. you can not submit your Proposal Draft after you have submitted the Proposal).",
      "EXTENSION POLICY": "Each student has a single extension which they may use on any individual project or project stage. To request an extension, students should: 1. Email the professor and TA no later than 24 hours prior to the deadline indicating your desire to use your extension. 2. Provide a new, reasonable date and time for the assignment to be due. If the assignment is a draft or project stage of a larger project, this date needs to come before the larger project is due. For larger projects, this new date should be within a week* of the original due date. a. This new date/time will be considered the new deadline for the assignment b. A note will be added to Canvas with this new due date for mutual reference c. The student will submit the assignment as instructed on the assignment sheet d. The student should notify the professor and TA an email indicating you have submitted your assignment and it is ready for grading. *For end of semester projects, the professor may require a shorter extension window due to grading deadlines",
      "ACADEMIC CONDUCT": "Plagiarism is a serious offense that will result in the student failing the course. All academic integrity violations will be reported to the associate dean's office for the student’s program of study and the Carnegie Mellon University Division of Student Affairs. If an academic integrity violation is suspected, the student will be contacted to meet with the instructor to determine if a violation has occurred based on Carnegie Mellon University’s Policy on Academic Integrity.",

        "Course Description": "This is a project-based course designed to provide training and experience in solving real-world problems using machine learning, with a focus on problems from public policy and social good. Through lectures, discussions, readings, and project assignments, students will learn about and experience building end-to-end machine learning systems, starting from project definition and scoping, to modeling, to field validation and turning their analysis into action. Through the course, students will develop skills in problem formulation, working with messy data, communicating about machine learning with non-technical stakeholders, model interpretability, understanding and mitigating algorithmic bias and disparities, evaluating the impact of deployed models, and understanding the ethical implications of design choices made throughout the pipeline.",
        "Pre-Requisites": "Students will be expected to know Python (for data analysis and machine learning), SQL, and have prior graduate coursework in machine learning. This course assumes that you have taken graduate Machine Learning courses before and is focused on teaching how to use machine learning to solve real-world problems. Experience with git(hub) will be helpful and is highly recommended.",
        "Course Resources": {
          "Textbook": "The course will rely on selected readings from various sources and has no required textbook – each week, we’ll have selected readings from a variety of sources.",
          "Software": "Students will be expected to store project code in a shared github repository, so you should create an account if you do not already have one (github.com). In the recitation session of week 2 the TAs will do a presentation on Github."
        },
        "Course Objectives": [
          "At the end of this course, you should be able to:",
          "*  Understand where machine learning fits as part of your analytical toolkit",
          "*  Understand the entire machine learning process (and get hands-on experience doing most of it)",
          "*  Learn how to use and evaluate machine learning methods (that you have covered in earlier classes) in the context of real problems.",
          "*  Be critical about the ethical implications of the use of machine learning in real-world applications."
        ],
        "Course Organization": "In general, the course will be structured around three sessions each week: During the Tuesday and Thursday sessions, we’ll focus on structured lectures, discussions of the weekly topic, and students’ presentations. As we move into the semester and the projects are underway, Thursday sessions will be reserved for group meetings and project work. Sometimes groups have trouble coordinating regular meeting times, so we want to find a way to dedicate some class time to help resolve this challenge. During the Friday lab/recitation sessions, we’ll discuss technical skills and tools you’ll need for the project work early in the semester and then shift to check-ins with each team to discuss the status of their project work, generally surrounding short update assignments due on Wednesdays. Although we’re dedicating some time in class to work with your group, please note that successfully completing the project will require work outside of class time as well and will constitute the majority of the “homework” for the course.",
        "Class expectations": {
          "Attendance": "Everyone is expected to attend – and participate in – lectures. Students may miss two lectures with no penalty. If you anticipate more absences, please let me know as early as possible. Because this course is focused on discussion with your classmates, attending each session is important to both your ability to learn from the course and to contribute to what others get out of it as well.",
          "Classroom behavior": "Please arrive on time. If you arrive after the class has started, please enter quietly to avoid distracting other students and interrupting the lecture. If you arrive more than 20 minutes late to the class, it will count as a missed lecture. Laptops and iPads are permitted in class for taking notes or for class activities. Please refrain from using cell phones or electronics for other purposes during class. This might distract other students and keep you from fully understanding the material.",
          "Participation": "Participation is key to keep the class interactive. All questions are good questions. You are all here to learn and your question might help other students. We are all responsible for creating a safe and collaborative learning environment. For doing so, I expect you to respect each other ideas and learning process. All of you have different experiences and knowledge to bring to the class.",
          "Communication": "If you need to communicate with me, please come to my office hours or send me an email. If you have time conflicts with my office hours, email me and we can arrange another time. I am committed to replying to your emails within 24 hours on weekdays. For emails sent after 6:00 pm on Fridays, please allow until Monday morning."
        },
        "Assessment": {
          "Project (50%)": "Throughout the semester, students will work together in small groups on an applied machine learning project that will illustrate the concepts discussed in class and readings. Please look at the project description for more details on the assignments and grade distribution.",
          "Paper presentation and report (30%)": "Each student will have to present a paper and write a report of the presentation. In this applied class, we will cover multiple examples and these presentations will allow you and your peers to have a broader understanding of machine learning applications for public policy. Students will have one week to prepare for the presentation. The report should be submitted no later than 48 hours after the presentation. On Canvas you will find the details of the presentation.",
          "Participation (10%)": "Participation will be graded based on participation in class activities and discussions. To make the class interactive, I expect all of you to come prepared to class, engage in class discussions, listen to your classmates, and share your thoughts from the readings and the class activities.",
          "Attendance (10%)": "Students may miss two classes with no penalty. If you anticipate more absences, please speak with me as early as possible. For every missed class, excluding the first missed class, students will get a penalization in class attendance.",
          "Regrade policy": "We are committed to returning work to you as quickly as possible. Our goal is to grade assignments and return them within 1 week of the due date. All appeals for grading must be made within 2 weeks of the due date of the assignments. The appeal must be written and include the specific reason why you believe the grade is incorrect. You must submit the written appeal to me during office hours or after class."
        },
        "Performance evaluation": "The final grade for the course will consist of grades from the items mentioned above. Your final grade will be determined by your point placement on the following scale: Graduate students: 94% or more A, 84%-86.9% B, 74%-76.9% C, 90%-93.9% A-, 80%-83.9% B-, 70%-73.9% C, 87% -89.9% B+, 77%-79.9% C+, 0-69.9% R. Undergraduate students: 94% or more A, 74%-83.9% C, 0-69.9% R. Be aware that I do not round up. That means that to pass the course you need 70% or more. This applies to all the items on the placement scale. For example, if you get a 93.99% in the class, your grade will be an A-. You need 94% or more to get an A."
      },
      "Academic Integrity": {
        "Description": "In this class, you may use generative AI programs ONLY as a tool for your coding assignments. These programs can be powerful tools for learning and other productive pursuits, including the completion of some assignments in less time, helping you generate new ideas, or serving as a personalized learning tool. However, your responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow the academic integrity guidelines of the university and of this class. If you use one of these generative AI tools to develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work. In practice, cutting and pasting content from any source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing content from a generative AI without citation is plagiarism. Similarly, using any generative AI tool without appropriate acknowledgement will be treated as plagiarism. The university’s policy on plagiarism applies to all uncited or improperly cited use of work, whether that work is created by human beings alone or in collaboration with a generative AI."

        "Accommodation": "If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.",
        "Well being": "School can be challenging at times. Make sure to take time for yourself and do activities you enjoy. The University Provost provides the following thoughts that I believe are important to share. Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.",
        "Inclusion and Diversity": "We must treat every individual with respect. We at Heinz College are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Inclusion is ensuring everyone feels respected in the environments they interact with other. Diversity, can be broadly defined as the presence of people who identify with multiple attributes, these include but are not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. I will work to promote and create an inclusive and equitable learning environment. I understand that diverse backgrounds require different learning tools and I am committed to provide each of you with the tools you need to grow and learn in my class. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. The university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources: Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150, Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a report by calling 844587-0793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com. All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.",

        "Course": "STRATEGIC PRESENTATION SKILLS (90-718)",
        "Description": "This course equips students with essential skills to confidently navigate professional communication scenarios, such as interviews, webinars, and face-to-face presentations. Activities include analyzing an audience, crafting an outline, developing cohesive visuals, and speaking extemporaneously. By the end of this course, students learn to adapt communication strategies to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders. They will also possess the necessary tools to excel in a wide range of professional settings, contributing to their overall academic and professional success.",
        "Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools": "Some assignments encourage the use of AI for content creation and delivery. However, it is imperative that students verify the accuracy and credibility of the content, the references, and the evidence before sharing their work. Conversely, some assignments prohibit the use of AI for content creation and delivery. In these cases, students are required to demonstrate mastery of course objectives without AI assistance. This ensures that students are well-equipped for their professional careers through impromptu interactions with supervisors, co-workers, and clients.",
        "Use of Virtual Reality (VR)": "Some homework assignments can be completed in Professor Hyatt’s VR lab using Ovation VR. While it is optional to use VR for practice, combining VR training with feedback from in-person practice sessions has proven to be an effective way to enhance public speaking skills."

To remove ambiguity, some faculty have chosen an attendance policy with no distinction between excused and unexcused. With this approach, instructors can make clear that the reason for their attendance policy is to accurately reflect the amount of information that the student engaged with during class.",

          "Description": "If you’re not present, you cannot engage with class activities. With daily group interactions and impromptu speaking exercises, the class relies heavily on active participation for practice sessions and feedback. Since there is no distinction between excused and unexcused, you do not need to email the professor or the TA to provide a reason for an absence. If you’re unable to attend class, review the weekly links on Canvas and meet with the TA. Furthermore, to protect a student’s right to privacy during practice sessions and group work activities, classes are not recorded. Face-to-face learning is an expectation at Heinz College.",

            "Description": "As an interactive class, participation is an expectation (e.g., engaging with speakers by asking questions, providing feedback after speeches, working productively with group members). Therefore, you are expected to receive a 0 score. However, you may be awarded additional points for extra effort, or you may receive negative points for a lack of effort. As a note, these points are completely at the professor's discretion and based on direct observations during class."

The presenter does not get lost in thought, stumble over words, or repeat sentences (due to memorizing and saying) and do not distract from the message. The presenter uses clear screens as cues to discuss content.

        "Description": "After a deadline, submit assignments to the “Late Work” folder on Canvas. Your work will not be accepted via email since I utilize the commenting tools on Canvas to provide feedback. Since everyone has an acceptable excuse for late work, I cannot give special consideration to some and not others regarding the penalty for submitting a late assignment. Since I am continuously grading weekly assignments (videos and reflections), I review late work at the end of the semester, not when you submit the assignment. For major assignments, grading starts at 80% of the total score. For reflections (only worth 10 points), I cannot accept late work. A reflection (e.g., reviewing a 30-second to 2-minute elevator pitch) only takes a few minutes to write. Therefore, it must be completed during the week that it was assigned. Please do not submit reflections and expect them to be graded after the deadline has passed. Reflections are posted to Acclaim, not Canvas; therefore, I do not receive notifications on this platform for late submissions."

      "MISSING (ungraded) WORK": {
        "Description": "A draft, ungraded work, is an important part of the learning process. If a quality draft is not submitted, -10 points are deducted from your participation score. Without a quality draft, you cannot fully participate with in-class activities for group work, and there is a penalty for not completing your homework. Drafts are utilized to provide feedback to a student prior to submitting the work for a grade."

        "Description": "Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. There are many resources available on campus, and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. You are not alone. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings of anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is available to help you. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty, or family member for help. If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night."

This policy is meant to cover such issues as job interviews, travel and so on. After the seven days are spent, there is a penalty of 10% per day late.",
        "Policy": "Policy on Copying code without citing it is cheating. Copying code from a fellow student is cheating. However, if you cite the source of the code, you may choose to use a large language model to assist with your programming work. Note that LLMs often make mistakes. You are responsible for any errors or problems that may be present in the code that you submit. The closed book exams are designed to test your knowledge and coding skills. So, if you do use a large language model, be sure to master the material and truly understand the code before taking an exam. Be sure to note that you must follow the academic integrity guidelines of the university. If you use a generative AI tool to develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work, just as you should cite code acquired from any other source. If you copy code from the Web, be sure to provide a comment in the code with the exact URL where the code was copied from. Code that is provided by the instructor is allowed as long as the code is clearly cited as being provided by the instructor. Of course, if you have violated the spirit of the project, you will earn zero points.",

If you are still not satisfied with the TA's grade, please contact me immediately. My initial reaction will be to support the TA's grade. In some cases, however, I might agree with the student and ask for the grade to be adjusted. Please make any grading concerns known to the TA immediately. Set up an appointment with the TA and get the matter resolved.",
        "Use of Canvas": "There will be a Canvas site for the course. The Piazza links are located there and will be used as a discussion board. Grades will be posted there and assignments will be submitted there. It is far better to post a question to the discussion board than it is to send your instructor or TA an email.

        "Course Description": "Professional Speaking provides practical instruction for preparing and delivering professional presentations and communicating in professional situations. Activities and assignments include: developing targeted, strategic messages; writing outlines; creating cohesive visuals; exploring new technologies; and, speaking extemporaneously. Students engage specific audiences using a communication style (both verbal and nonverbal) suitable for workplace environments. Overall, the course helps students develop confidence and apply effective techniques when speaking in a public setting.",
        "Text(s)": "Selected texts to be provided by the instructor",
        "Objectives": {
          "A": "Compare and contrast effective versus ineffective professional presentations",
          "B": "Conduct an audience analysis and adapt messages to particular audience members",
          "C": "Establish presence through professional attire, appropriate posture, and purposeful gestures",
          "D": "Structure a logical, cohesive message via verbal and visual transitional devices",
          "E": "Maintain time constraints, a consistent pace, adequate volume and clarity in voice projection, and eye contact",
          "F": "Design and utilize visuals (e.g. slides, logos, photographs, tables, graphs, charts, and diagrams) effectively",
          "G": "Demonstrate the use of advanced presentation technologies as a method of delivering content",
          "H": "Generate interaction with attendees and respond eloquently to questions from the audience",
          "I": "Self-evaluate professional development as a public speaker"
        },
        "Registration": "Once a section is full, then enrollment is dependent on: (1) the number of registered students who drop the section, and (2) the waitlist order. Students who miss the first-class meeting can be automatically dropped from the course. After the initial session, registration is closed. Priority registration may be given to students for whom Professional Speaking is required (including BSCF seniors).",
        "Classroom Policies": "Professional conduct is necessary. While our class is in session, act as though you are in a staff or client meeting. For example, refrain from: accessing personal messages; sleeping; or, doing other coursework. Demonstrate respect for everyone in the room through active listening, eye contact, and productive (skills-focused) comments."
      },
      "ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION": "This course consists of lectures, discussions, impromptu speaking exercises, and planned presentations. Attendance is required; it is particularly important given the concentrated schedule of the mini format and to benefit from speaking exercises conducted during class. For this reason, a failing grade for the course will be issued for three or more unexcused absences. In addition to attendance, participation includes engaging in class discussions, skills-building exercises, and TA sessions. The course grade can be lowered as a result of: lateness, unexcused absences, using a mobile device in class (unless for a class exercise or presentation), or inadequate preparation for class exercises.",
      "WELLNESS": "Carnegie Mellon University has a wide array of resources and programs to support student wellness. Students are encouraged to access these resources, and to contact the instructor if a health or safety concern arises.",
      "Written Assignments": "Instructions for assignments will be posted to Canvas and explained in detail during class. Written assignments (Audience Analysis, Key Points with Q & A, and Visuals) are due as an upload to Canvas (in designated area) and as a printed copy in class by the start of our session on the dates stipulated in the syllabus. Include your name and section in the file. Presentations may be staggered over two class meetings (given time constraints); however, every student must be prepared to present on the due date stated in the syllabus.",
      "LATE ASSIGNMENT POLICY": "If a student submits a paper late, the student may be jeopardizing their ability to receive comments on the first and final draft. While allotments can be made for extenuating circumstances, if the assignment is handed in late, half of a letter grade will be deducted from the overall score, for every day past the due date. For instance, if you submit an assignment two days late, then the highest grade you can receive is 90%.",
      "PURPOSE OF DRAFTS": "Drafts serve as preparation for individual meetings with instructor or the TA and for peer-review sessions for feedback prior to submitting the final, graded version. Further, drafts are useful for time management. Drafts are graded upon completion. Grade deductions will occur if a draft is incomplete, or if there is a lack of participation during the guided editing sessions. Drafts should be submitted as a stapled hard copy during class, on the corresponding due date(s).",
      "POLICY ON STUDENT ACCOMMODATIONS": "The Carnegie Mellon University Office of Disability Resources reviews requests for “reasonable accommodations, academic adjustments, and auxiliary aids and services.” Students can work with the instructor to arrange accommodations as needed on a case-by-case basis once accommodations are granted by the Office of Disability Resources. GLOBAL COMMUNICATION CENTER (GCC) The GCC provides communication consulting free-of-charge. Use this resource, located on campus in Hunt Library, to enhance your academic performance: https://www.cmu.edu/gcc/.",
      "Evaluation": "The Heinz College rubric is included in this syllabus. Assignment specific editing checklists will be provided during class.",

We’ll focus on how to move through the stages of a consulting engagement, on how to apply a methodology that we’ve developed inside ConsultingLab (called, appropriately enough, “The ConsultingLab Way”) to help you approach and manage engagements, and on the unwritten, “soft” skills that are the foundation of a successful consulting career.\",\n      \"Course Goals\": [\n        \"Get you comfortable with the consulting environment;\",\n        \"Give you immediately-applicable consulting skills to apply;\",\n        \"Expose you to a variety of consulting situations and activities, including analyzing RFPs, team participation and leadership, project management, critical thinking, creative solution, design thinking, presentation skills, “reading” clients, and developing effective relationships;\",\n        \"Have you come out a more prepared, confident, and comfortable professional, able to present yourself and your solutions more clearly, powerfully, and effectively, and add value to the consultant-client relationship at every stage.\",\n        \"Most important, you’ll work on a real assignment, for a real client, that will have a real deliverable, and have real impact.\"\n      ],\n      \"Our Projects\": {\n        \"We are still waiting on some Project Start Forms, but our tentative list of projects is\": {\n          \"Animal Friends\": \"Development of long-term strategic plan and brand guidance.\",\n          \"City of Pittsburgh\": [\n            \"Development of a city government AI Policy.\",\n            \"Development of plan to use drones for city services.\",\n            \"Using AI and computer vision for street assessments.\",\n            \"Development of digital twin for infrastructure modeling.\"\n          ],\n          \"National League of Cities\": \"Development of unified multiplier to “crosswalk” data between federal programs.\",\n          \"RootLocal\": \"Development of chatbot to Increase use of GIS-mapped database of sustainability resources.\",\n          \"Ihavetherightto.org\": \"Development of data strategy and instruments to track effectiveness of programs promoting sexual- and gender-violence awareness and positive behaviors.\",\n          \"US Army\": \"Development of recommendations for a suite of tag solutions (i.e. active, passive, bar code, QR code, mesh, etc.) to modernize reference data sets, end point devices, and the means of collection and reporting.\"\n        },\n        \"More information on the projects can be found in the “Project Start Forms” folder in the “Files” section of Canvas.\",\n        \"Teams will be formed by the TA based on your preferences (look in “Announcements” on Canvas for the link), skillsets required on each project, collaborative opportunities, and creative randomness, just like in, you know, a consulting firm.\"\n      ],\n      \"Texts and readings\": [\n        {\n          \"Title\": \"Making Things Happen\",\n          \"Author\": \"Scott Berkun\",\n          \"Publisher\": \"O’Reilly Media\",\n          \"Year\": 2008,\n          \"ISBN-13\": \"978-0596517717\",\n          \"Description\": \"CMU alum Scott Berkun wrote one of the best books I’ve read on the “whole” of project management, not just the techniques.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Title\": \"The Art of the Start\",\n          \"Author\": \"Guy Kawasaki\",\n          \"Publisher\": \"Portfolio Hardcover\",\n          \"Year\": 2004,\n          \"ISBN-13\": \"978-1591840565\",\n          \"Description\": \"Guy is a former Apple “low badge number” and largely responsible for their evangelism program.

This penchant for ignorance is particularly noticeable in United States’ culture and current political climate and has deep, far-reaching, and profoundly disturbing present and future impact. I couldn’t care less what political, religious, social, or other existential affiliation you have, but I cannot abide stupidity, laziness, or sloppiness. What this means in practical terms is that everything that you present in this class must be based on solid, vetted, verified, trusted, current, neutral evidence: solid academic research, business research or (on rare occasions, as a supplement to research or in areas where research is scarce because of the newness of the field), expert testimony. In this class critical thinking skills and evaluation of evidence are elemental to good decision-making and the success of the engagement. Find evidence. Use evidence. Cite evidence.\",\n      \"Accommodations for Students with Disabilities\": \"If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, please discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible.

So your first job is to take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep (!) and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us struggle from time to time and benefit from support during those times. Carnegie Mellon has many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of your college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is always helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, get help. Call Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) at 412-268-2922 or visit their website: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Reach out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help. If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night: CaPS: 412-268-2922. Re:solve Crisis Network: 888-796-8226 If the situation is life threatening, call the CMU Police at 412-268-2323; off campus call 911. If you have questions about this or your coursework, please let me know.\",\n      \"Late or missed work\": \"From time to time, extenuating circumstances may arise (a job interview, for example) that interfere with your ability to make a presentation or complete an assignment as scheduled. While we obviously expect you to schedule such events around class times, if you have no alternative but to miss a class you must alert your team, the professor, and the TA as soon as you are aware of the need (so, before your absence) and we will try to find an alternate time or solution. Failure to inform the professor or TA before your absence will result in a reduced grade.\",\n      \"Professionalism\": \"We expect that you will conduct yourselves as professional consultants in the real world. That means that you are on time for class and meetings, that you behave in a professional manner with clients, and that you take your responsibilities to the class, your team, and your client seriously. Failure to do so will result in a reduced grade.\",\n      \"Grading Rubric\": {\n        \"For your Mid-term and Final presentations, we’ll assess and evaluate (on a 1-5 scale) the following\": [\n          \"Analysis of the issue: How well are you identifying the problem behind the problem?\",\n          \"Strategy for solution: How effective is your approach to getting the information that you need?\",\n          \"Stakeholder identification & buy-in strategy: Have you identified all relevant stakeholders and gotten them “on board?”\",\n          \"Methodology for your solution: How have you tailored your methodology to create an effective solution?\",\n          \"Quality of the solution: What evidence supports your solution?\",\n          \"Risk Mitigation: Have you effectively identified risks & articulated a mitigation strategy for each?\",\n          \"Professionalism: Are you conducting yourselves as real consultants with the client & with each other?

Commerce has metamorphosed and is continually being transformed by these deviations to the norm, leading to new markets and potential business opportunities. To realize success in making critical business decisions, the IT leader must have a grounded understanding of the technology in use, potentials for new technology, and the ability to strategize and understand the impacts of incorporating technology in the business or industry they serve, both nationally and globally. Likewise, the IT leader must also show precise focus to the application of establishing a systematic path that encourages interactions between digital and physical markets."

        "Introduction": "Whether we like it or not, all the skill, talent, and creativity in the world isn’t enough in the workplace. The ability to actively communicate ideas quickly, credibly, and memorably is a key “soft skill” that is a requirement for senior workers, and a prerequisite for advancement in almost every industry. This course gives students who aren’t natural-born presenters (which is about 99% of the population) some key skills, techniques, tricks, and insights into the essence of verbal communication in the enterprise, and will help you give your ideas the noticeability and power they need in today’s marketplace. Whether you’re looking for a job, a raise, a way to have your voice heard more convincingly and effectively in meetings, or funding for a big idea, your ability to effectively present yourself and your ideas is a critical and often overlooked skill.",

          "* Learn that the real point of any communication is to inform, persuade, understand, share ideas, and (especially in the workplace) cause action.": null

        "Tools": "Notebook, Journal, iPad, Surface, laptop, index cards, stone tablet (not recommended) or something to take good notes with and keep good notes in. Good notetaking is essential to success in this course. Let me say that again in bigger type: Good notetaking is essential to success in this course.",
        "Texts and readings": "There are no assigned texts for the course. Check out the “Learning Resources” listed in this syllabus and the long list of helpful books and other resources on my website. And (see above) take a lot of notes because I mention a lot of sources and evidence in class.",
        "Course Outcomes/Learning Objectives": {

          "Attendance": "On the one hand, it’s your money and if you want to blow off the course it should be your decision, and your consequences that you have to live with. On the other, it’s a course about effectively communicating, and so its central concept is one of communicating. You will learn not just by listening to the instructor but by doing, by listening to your classmates doing and giving feedback, and by measuring your own improvement over time. Since you have an obligation to your fellow students to be there for them and give feedback, and since the instructor and the university have an obligation to put prepared, professional graduates out in an unforgiving and continually changing workplace, attendance at each class is urged. I won’t say that it is mandatory, as you’re all adults and should be able to figure out for yourselves what to do. But attendance impacts learning and that’s why you’re here. I do notice attendance, and grade accordingly.",
          "Scheme": "Here’s how your grade gets decided:",
          "Lightning Round Presentations": "10%",
          "Convince Me Presentation": "10%",

          "Final Presentation": "45%",
          "Paper": "15%",
          "Academic Integrity": "In other words, cheating. Here’s the good news: this is a really hard course to cheat in. Here’s even better news: we can be very clear about what cheating is (and if you have any question about whether something would be considered cheating, ask me, our TA, the Program Director, the Dean, another faculty member)… Cheating: “intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise.” Fabrication : “intentional and unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise.” Plagiarism: “deliberate adoption or reproduction of ideas or words or statements of another person as one’s own without acknowledgement.” Put simply: you cannot just copy-and-paste a sentence, paragraph, table, image, or other work from another document or web page and represent it as your work, especially if it’s a long passage. You can reproduce a short statement, for exposition, as long as there are quotation marks around the statement, and it has a proper inline citation (I prefer APA style, but IEEE or MLA are acceptable). This lets me (and everyone else) know what work you are building on or relating to, and what work is your original thinking.",
          "Academic Rigor": "Like many (and I hope most) people, I am deeply troubled by the attitude of indifference towards evidence, the sophomoric fact-checking (if it happens at all), and the acceptance of outright lies that are prevalent in current global culture. This penchant for ignorance is particularly noticeable in United States’ culture and current political climate and has deep, far-reaching, and profoundly disturbing present and future impact. I couldn’t care less what political, religious, social, or other existential affiliation you have, but I cannot abide willful stupidity, laziness, or sloppiness. What this means in practical terms is that everything that you present in this class must be based on solid, vetted, verified, trusted, current, neutral evidence: solid academic research, business research or (on rare occasions, as a supplement to research or in areas where research is scarce because of the newness of the field), expert testimony. In this class we won’t concentrate just on the mechanics of communication, but also on the commitment to evidence and the critical thinking skills that are elemental to solid argument and good decision-making. What this means, even more to the point, is that it is insufficient to merely cough up the first-page Google search of a topic and think that you’ve done your research. You are graduate students at Carnegie Mellon; we expect academic rigor. Vet your sources. Cite your sources. Develop strong arguments. Write and present professionally. Don’t lift others’ work and just plop it into an assignment (even with citation), for example.",
          "Accommodations for Students with Disabilities": "If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, please discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.",
          "Taking care of yourself": "This is a stressful program, a stressful time of your life in general, and a stressful time for the world. So your first job is to take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep (!) and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us are struggling in one way or another, and will benefit from support. Carnegie Mellon has many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of your college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is always the right thing to do.",
          "Late or missed work": "From time to time, extenuating circumstances may arise that interfere with your ability to make a presentation or complete an assignment as scheduled. While we obviously expect you to schedule such events around class times, if you have no alternative but to miss a class you must alert the professor and TA as soon as you are aware of the need and we will try to find an alternate time or solution. I also take points off when you arrive late to class. It’s disrespectful to the class and to me, disruptive to your colleagues as they are presenting, and unprofessional.",
          "Presentation Grading Rubric": "This matrix tells you what I expect of you, what I look for, and how it translates to points that translate to a grade. What I expect of you of course is consistent, superior performance, and by the end of the course, that’s what you should be able to deliver (that’s why the final presentations are most of your grade). More important though, this matrix tells you what the organizations that are going to hire you expect of you. I’ve based it on the rubrics presented in the American Journal of Business Education – Fourth Quarter 2008 as well as other research-supported best practices and those that I’ve observed and categorized over my teaching and business careers."
        },
        "Information Point": "Prepare “Information Point” presentation. Find one evidence-supported fact (with full source cited) about effectively and/or efficiently communicating information, and support it with one ppt slide. You have 1 minute to explain and share it with the class.",
        "Convince Me": "Prepare “Convince Me” 2-minute presentation on your final presentation topic that introduces your topic, convinces us that it can and should be studied, & shows your workplan. Your final presentation is an 8-minute presentation",
        "Tech Talk": "Prepare “Tech Talk” Lightning Round presentation: Take a 2-minute slice of a technical presentation that you have already done and, using the techniques learned in class, revise it to be a better 2-minute slice. DO NOT CONDENSE THE ENTIRE PRESENTATION TO 2 MINUTES.",
        "Dear Data": "Prepare “Dear Data” Lightning Round presentation. As discussed in class, in this Lightning Round you have 2 minutes to show us a simple (or complex, if you like) data visualization of anything related to your life. Not something random; your life. OK? (Like the number and types of doors that you walk through in a week, get it?)",
        "Final Presentation": "For your assigned subject, clearly and effectively present your work as described in the “Your Final Presentation” section below. You’ll have 8 minutes to present, using all of the techniques and best practices covered in the course, and you are graded on your critical thinking and the clarity, completeness, and understandability of your evidence. Final presentations are due to the TA no later than 4/21/25, 11:59pm ET. No presentations will be accepted, nor changes permitted, after that time. You will be called randomly to present, so be ready.",

      "PLAGIARISM AND CHEATING NOTICE": "Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are taken extremely seriously. Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or assignment or as cheating on an examination, regardless of whether it is a take-home or in-class examination. The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the program. There are many other ways in which a violation can occur. Academic Dishonesty: Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards inside and outside the classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e. plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration) is obviously discouraged and will be treated appropriately. The usual penalty for violations is a failing grade for the particular assignment in question; however, in some instances, such actions may result in a failing grade for the course."
    },
    "ACCOMMODATIONS": "If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.",
    "STUDENT WELLNESS": "As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus at: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412-268-2922.",
    "DIVERSITY STATEMENT": "We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources: Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150 Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: reportit.net username: tartans password: plaid All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just."

Your product will then need to clean, organize, and analyze the obtained data to produce interesting results for the user to look at (statistical results, tables, plots, ...) and perhaps interact with. Since this is a Python course, all of this will need to be in Python code: you may not download data using a browser, clean and organize the data in Excel, and then just do the analysis and display part in Python.

      "Collaboration": "You are encouraged to discuss homework, quizzes and project work, with your fellow students and as a group during class sessions. However, any work you submit must be your own. You must acknowledge in your submission any help received on your assignments. That is, you must include a comment in your homework submission that clearly states the name of the resource or reference from which you received assistance. Submissions that fail to properly acknowledge help from other students or non-class sources will receive no credit. Copied work will receive no credit. Any and all violations will be reported to Heinz College administration. All students are expected to comply with the CMU policy on academic integrity. This policy can be found online at http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/.",
      "What constitutes plagiarism in a coding class?": "The course collaboration policy allows you to discuss the problems with other students, but requires that you complete the work on your own. Every line of text and line of code that you submit must be written by you personally. You may not refer to another student's code, or a 'common set of code' while writing your own code. You may, of course, copy/modify lines of code that you saw in any lecture or during in-class 'lab work'. The following discussion of code copying is taken from the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Washington. You may find this discussion helpful in understanding the bounds of the collaboration policy. '[It is] important to make sure that the assistance you receive consists of general advice that does not cross the boundary into using code or answers written by someone else. It is fine to discuss ideas and strategies, but you should be careful to write your programs on your own.' 'You must not share actual program code with other students. In particular, you should not ask anyone to give you a copy of their code or, conversely, give your code to another student who asks you for it; nor should you post your solutions on the web, in public repositories, or any other publicly accessible place. [You may not work out a full communal solution on a whiteboard/blackboard/paper and then transcribe the communal code for your submission.] Similarly, you should not discuss your algorithmic strategies to such an extent that you and your collaborators end up turning in [essentially] the same code. Discuss ideas together, but do the coding on your own.' 'Modifying code or other artifacts does not make it your own. In many cases, students take deliberate measures -- rewriting comments, changing variable names, and so forth -- to disguise the fact that their work is copied from someone else. It is still not your work. Despite such cosmetic changes, similarities between student solutions are easy to detect. Programming style is highly idiosyncratic, and the chance that two submissions would be the same except for changes of the sort made easy by a text editor is vanishingly small. In addition to solutions from previous years or from other students, you may come across helpful code on the Internet or from other sources outside the class. Modifying it does not make it yours.' '[I] allow exceptions in certain obvious instances. For example, you might be assigned to work with a project team. In that case, developing a solution as a team is expected. The instructor might also give you starter code, or permit use of local libraries. Anything which the instructor explicitly gives you doesn't normally need to be cited. Likewise, help you receive from course staff doesn't need to be cited.' Generative AI Like any other online resource, generative AI (ChatGPT, Google Bard, Bing, etc) are allowed as additional tools in this class for learning and generating correct Python code. However, your responsibilities as a student remain the same – you must follow the academic integrity guidelines of the university and the guidance for citations given above. If you use any generative AI, you are required to cite the tool’s contributions to your final work – using these resources without proper citation is considered plagiarism. Ultimately, you are responsible for the content that you submit! If you have any questions about any of the course policies, please don't hesitate to ask directly.",
      "Course Policies": {
        "Attendance & Participation": "Regular class attendance is expected, although accommodations can be made for absences with good reason. Questions during class and discussions are strongly encouraged. The best way to learn Python is by creating code, making mistakes, and finding ways to produce results. Course time will be interactive with students encouraged to use their laptops/computers to connect and participate in the course as well as run Python code and follow along with real time exercises. Course information in the form of slides will usually be shared before the start of class, and any questions about the material can be asked during the class session. There will be exercises during some of the classes and you will be asked to code along and participate by answering questions and offering code syntax and format.",
        "Accommodations for students with disabilities": "If you have a disability and require accommodations, please contact Catherine Getchell, Director of Disability Resources, 412-268-6121, getchell@cmu.edu. If you have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs as early in the semester as possible.

      "Course Description": "The widespread emergence of big data storage needs has driven the development and adoption of a new class of non-relational databases commonly referred to as NoSQL databases. This course will explore the origins of NoSQL databases and the characteristics that distinguish them from traditional relational database management systems. Core concepts of NoSQL databases will be presented, followed by an exploration of how different database technologies implement these core concepts. We will take a closer look at 1-2 databases from each of the four main NoSQL data models (key-value, column family, document, and graph), highlighting the business needs that drive the development and use of each database. Finally, we will present criteria that decision makers should consider when choosing between relational and non-relational databases and techniques for selecting the NoSQL database that best addresses specific use cases."

Each student is responsible for handing in their own work. For any assignment found to be the partial or complete result of cheating or plagiarism, your grade for that assignment will be zero. Cheating is defined as inappropriate collaboration among students on an assignment. This can include copying someone else’s work with or without alteration. When students are found to be collaborating in this way, BOTH will pay the penalty regardless of who originated the work."

      "Resources": "There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/.

It is one of the most applied data science techniques in business - used extensively in finance, in supply chain management, and in production and inventory planning. Moreover, it has a well established theoretical grounding in statistics and dynamic systems theory. Yet, it retains something of an outsider status in data science compared to more recent and popular machine learning methods such as image recognition and natural language processing. Consequently, Time Series Forecasting gets little or no treatment at all in introductory data science and machine learning courses. This course is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods without deep diving into the theoretical details behind each method. Although, the references at the end of each week will fill in many of those details. The course is intended for the following three audiences.",

Let me know if there is a gap in your technology set-up as soon as possible, and we will work together to find a solution.",
        "Attendance Policy - mandatory - 5% of the grades are towards attendance and engagement in class. If you are consistently unable to attend the live zoom sessions due to any reason, you may stay registered and watch the lecture recordings afterwards but will lose the 5% participation points for not attending live.",
        "For the purpose of building a classroom community to drive better learning outcomes, it is mandatory to turn on your cameras during class. Having a virtual background is completely fine. We are already physically distanced. Let’s not be physically invisible too. If you cannot share your video for some valid reason, please let me know beforehand. Some or all class engagement points will be deducted for not turning on your cameras without giving me a heads up on a consistent basis.",
        "Assignments - This course has one quiz and two assignments that you need to complete individually. We do not have a final exam but we have a final group project that you need to complete working in groups with your peers. I’ll be sharing more details in class. All expectations and submission deadlines will be shared in class.",
        "Class presentations, datasets that we will be exploring, supervised readings, and any other content to supplement the learnings will be shared in class and via emails.",

      "LATE ASSIGNMENT POLICY": {
        "Description": "If a student submits a paper late, the student may be jeopardizing their ability to receive comments on the first and final draft. While allotments can be made for extenuating circumstances, if the assignment is handed in late, half of a letter grade will be deducted from the overall score, for every day past the due date.

Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources: Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150 Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: reportit.net username: tartans password: plaid All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions.

      "Course Description": "This course, along with its companions (90-760 Management Science II and an optional elective 94-833 Multicriteria Decision Making & Decision Analysis), are introductory courses in analytics and management science that survey various hands-on quantitative and modeling methods useful to decision makers and analysts. We will develop a practical toolkit for solving real-world decision-making problems. # 90-722 focuses on optimization models and methods. Optimization models provide a quantitative framework to guide decisions when you want to maximize (or minimize) some outcome, subject to various requirements. This applies to nearly any industry, such as: - booking patients for surgery to minimize wait times under schedule constraints, - ordering raw supply quantities to minimize manufacturing cost under demand constraints, or - allocating ventilators across hospital systems to minimize deaths under transportation constraints. By the end of the class, you will be able to take real problems such as these, translate them into mathematical formulations, solve them using Excel, and interpret the solutions. This skill will be a significant asset on the job market and in your career.",
      "Prerequisites/Corequisites": "This course has no formal prerequisites but assumes knowledge of college pre-calculus (or its equivalent), including summation notation, graphing, and interpreting linear and nonlinear functions. The course uses Excel intensively. If you are not comfortable with Excel, you should work through some Excel tutorials before the course begins.",
      "Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)": [
        "Model and solve quantitative problems in Excel – working with spreadsheets should feel second nature!",
        "Identify the right management science technique for your problem. You will become familiar with different problem-solving approaches and their limitations. Even if you aren’t the one implementing them day-to-day, you’ll know when to call upon the right specialists and consultants when the occasion arises.",
        "Apply management science techniques as an “end user modeler.”",
        "Take an end-to-end quantitative analytical approach to policy and business problems – from formalizing a problem in mathematical terms to analyzing the model results. In short, you should be able to use the language of mathematical modeling."
      ],
      "Course Materials": {
        "Textbook (Required)": "Cliff T. Ragsdale’s Spreadsheet Modeling and Decision Analysis: A Practical Introduction to Business Analytics, 8th edition. You can order the textbook from Cengage. You can also use the 6th or 7th editions, although you will want to watch out for problem number changes.",
        "Software": "You will need regular access to Microsoft Excel to complete assignments. If this is an issue, please let me know and we can make necessary arrangements."
      },
      "Assessments and Grading": {
        "Grading consists of four elements": {
          "50% exams": "Midterm and final exam (25% each)",
          "32% homework": "Best 4 out of 5 weekly HW assignments (8% each)",
          "14% recitation cases": "Two cases (7% each)",
          "4% attendance": "Requires attendance in lecture (with 2 “free passes”). See course policies below."
        },
        "Grading philosophy and procedures": "My goal is to prepare you to be quantitatively minded decision-makers and technical practitioners. The ILOs are designed to reflect these goals, and grading will be geared towards attainment of the ILOs. Homework and exam solutions will be posted with rubrics to explain point attribution. If you believe your assignment has a grading error, you must submit a regrade request in Gradescope within three days of grade release. You must accompany the request with a clear and specific written explanation."
      },
      "Course Expectations and Policies": {
        "Lecture Attendance": "I expect all students to attend lectures in person—and actively participate—but you will have 2 “free pass” absences to be flexible to unexpected conflicts; no reason required. Attendance will be logged through in-class question forms that you’ll fill out at the end of each class. These will serve primarily as a pulse check for me to see where the class stands and adjust accordingly. These questions will be graded for completion, not correctness—it is a way for you to stay actively engaged with the course content.",
        "Recitations": "Friday recitations will be hosted by your fantastic TA team. The content will vary by week, including lecture content review, in-class cases, and exams. In-person attendance is mandatory on exam and case days. Recitation will not be required on the weeks when there is no case or exam, but attendance is strongly encouraged. The recitations will allow you to do hands-on exercises, work collaboratively, and ask questions. You must attend your assigned recitation time (either B3 or C3); both sections are at capacity.",
        "Homework assignments": "Homework assignments will be due on Wednesdays (by midnight) via Gradescope and will generally cover the previous week’s lecture material. We will not accept late assignments, but the lowest grade across all homework assignments will be automatically dropped. You do not need to submit all five homework assignments – if you do not submit one, it will by default be the dropped assignment.",
        "In-class cases": "There will be two cases in recitation, which are meant to be low-stakes opportunities to put the course material into practice, honing your Excel skills and managerial interpretation of the results. These two recitations will have mandatory in-person attendance.",
        "Exams": "Both exams will occur in class. The exams will be closed book, but you will be allowed a “crib sheet”: one 8.5 x 11” handwritten sheet – one-sided for the first exam, and two-sided for the second exam. There will be no makeup exams offered, pending extraordinary circumstances. You can bring a standard calculator to the exam."
      },
      "Unforeseen Circumstances": "The past years have shown us new levels of uncertainty; there is a limit to how robust our plans can be! If unusual circumstances arise, health-wise or otherwise, please let me know immediately. I will aim to accommodate your needs (within reason), and we can work together to make a plan that allows you to succeed in this class.",
      "Lecture Recording": "We will record the lectures through Zoom and will post them on Canvas within 24 hours of each lecture. Note that the videos are intended solely for your personal educational use; they may not be shared with anyone outside of your course section (including students who enroll in the course in future semesters). Unauthorized sharing of the videos violates the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Students may not record lectures.",
      "Special Accommodations and Disability Resources": "If you require disability-related accommodations, I encourage you to reach out to me early in the semester. If you need an accommodations letter from the Office of Disability Resources, please contact the office at access@andrew.cmu.edu. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate.",
      "Academic integrity statement": "In this course, I will hold you to the high academic integrity standard expected of all CMU students. I do this for two reasons. First, it is essential to the learning process that you are the one doing the work. I have structured the assignments in this course to enable you to master the course material. Failing to do the work yourself will result in a lesser understanding of the content and, therefore, a less meaningful education for you. Second, it is important that there be a level playing field for all students in this course and in the College so that the rigor and integrity of Heinz’s educational program is maintained. Please review CMU’s Academic Integrity policy. Violating the policy in any way (e.g., plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, cheating, etc.) will result in disciplinary action. Possible sanctions include receiving a failing grade on the assignment or exam, being assigned a failing grade in the course, having a formal notation of disciplinary action placed on your record, suspension, or expulsion from CMU for the most serious cases. Finally, we are entering a new era of education with the emergence of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT – one that both educators and students are still navigating. In this class, we will adopt the following policy: - Generative AI tools can be used to support general learning or ungraded exercises, such as brainstorming or reviewing general principles. Please let me know if you use AI tools for these purposes! I would be eager to engage with any of you on this to get your perspective on where AI is useful and its opportunities/pitfalls. - AI tools should not be used for any graded assignments unless explicitly allowed. GenAI cannot be considered a substitute for developing the fundamental skills and expertise represented by the learning objectives of this course. Please note that these tools rely on predictive models to generate content that may appear correct, but has been shown to sometimes be incomplete, inaccurate, taken without attribution from other sources, and/or biased. You are ultimately responsible for the content of the information you submit and may not attempt to pass off any work generated by an AI program as your own.",
      "Inclusivity Statement": "I value an inclusive environment, as does the broader CMU community. I strongly believe that a culture that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion benefits all of us—it creates a better environment to work and study, and it unlocks creativity and innovation to make us better problem-solvers. With this in mind, I hope to foster a sense of community in this classroom and consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect. We welcome individuals of all backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, national origins, gender identities, sexual orientations, religious and political affiliations – and other visible and nonvisible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for every other class member. This is our shared responsibility. If this standard is not being upheld, please feel free to speak with me. Reporting Resources: Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They create an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or witnesses discrimination to speak out for justice and support their colleagues. Anyone can share these experiences anonymously using the Ethics Reporting Hotline (844-587-0793; cmu.ethicspoint.com). Additionally, the Title IX office is dedicated to promoting gender equity at Carnegie Mellon University, which includes coordinating the University's efforts to prevent and effectively respond to all forms of gender discrimination (including gender identity discrimination) and sexual misconduct impacting community members, including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, dating and domestic violence, and stalking.",
      "Student Wellness Statement": "First off, please take care of yourself! School is important, but it’s not the only priority – take breaks, find stress relievers, and get rest. Finding balance will help your quality of life and make you a better student. You will work best when you bring your whole self and energy to class. All of us struggle, and all of us can benefit from help in those times. As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating, and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may impact your ability to attend class, focus, complete work, take an exam, or participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus at: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412268-2922. If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night: - CaPS: 412-268-2922 - Re:solve Crisis Network: 888-796-8226 - If the situation is life threatening, call the police: 412-268-2323 (CMU) or 911 (off-campus)",

      },
      "Tips for success": "This class will move quickly – we have a lot to cover in seven weeks! I strongly encourage you to do the pre-readings assigned before each lecture, since this will make the lecture content much more digestible. Additionally, the most useful part of the class will be hands-on learning through case studies and homework assignments, so please take the time to get “in the weeds” with all exercises, even if you are working in a group for homework or case. This is where you get to apply the class material and see its practical value. The class will also use Excel extensively. Don’t worry too much about Excel mechanics during lectures. I will run through examples to show you what can be done, but recitation and office hours will be better places to work through Excel questions. There is also a ton of Excel content online, so Google will be your quickest resource if you run into spreadsheet bugs. If you feel like you are falling behind at any point, my door is open. I encourage you to stop by office hours discuss assignments, questions from lecture, or anything else (related to school or otherwise!); I look forward to seeing you! You can also set up time to meet 1:1 to discuss specific issues with me. Finally, Heinz has tutoring resources available to support your academic success – I am happy to connect you with a tutor as needed."

      "Course Description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative AI (GenAI) are revolutionizing industries by enhancing efficiency, decisionmaking, and innovation. However, many organizations encounter significant obstacles in realizing and scaling AI's full potential. Recent surveys reveal that nearly 75% of companies struggle to achieve and scale value from AI initiatives, with approximately 70% of challenges stemming from people and process issues, 20% from technology problems, and only 10% related to AI algorithms. Furthermore, over 50% of executives express concerns about integrating GenAI into their operations, citing issues such as limited traceability and irreproducibility of outcomes, which could lead to suboptimal or even illegal decision-making. This course is designed to tackle these challenges head-on, providing graduate-level students with a comprehensive understanding of the AI lifecycle. Students will learn how to navigate the complex process of identifying which business tasks should be automated through AI and which decisions should be augmented using AI. The course introduces practical frameworks essential for making these strategic decisions and successfully implementing AI solutions. Throughout the course, students will engage deeply with each stage of the AI lifecycle. They will learn to identify and prioritize high-impact AI use cases, conduct thorough cost-benefit analyses, and design strategic roadmaps aimed at maximizing return on investment (ROI). The curriculum blends theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience using industry-standard tools such as Jupyter Lab, Docker, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Kafka, and Evidently. These tools are critical for overcoming the common pitfalls associated with AI deployment and preparing students to scale AI systems in real-world environments. The course’s practical orientation is further enhanced through case studies that serve as a foundation for class discussions. These case studies provide students with the opportunity to analyze real-world AI applications, assess the challenges involved, and understand the decision-making processes behind successful implementations. Additionally, two guest lectures from seasoned industry practitioners will offer firsthand insights into the practical challenges of AI deployment across various sectors. A strong emphasis is placed on governance and trust, equipping students with the knowledge to develop ethical, transparent, and effective AI systems. Students will learn how to integrate AI into organizational processes, assess talent and skill gaps, and create strategies to build the necessary capabilities for sustained AI-driven innovation. This course is essential for students aspiring to careers as AI engineers, AI analysts, or AI governance experts. It is equally invaluable for business and technology students who wish to understand how to manage the development and deployment of AI systems. By the end of the course, students will possess a well-rounded, practical understanding of AI system management, enabling them to lead AI-driven projects and drive innovation across industries.",

We will begin with a philosophical and historical study of privacy and then explore recent public policy issues. We will examine the privacy protections provided by laws and regulations--primarily in the US and EU, but also in other countries--as well as the way technology can be used to protect privacy. We will emphasize technology-related privacy concerns and mitigation for technologies and settings like: online tracking and behavioral advertising, generative AI, internet cafes, drones, AR/VR headsets. We will also examine how technology-related privacy risks can affect individuals and groups of people disproportionately.",

Programming skills are not required. 17-733, 19-608, and 95-818 are 12-unit courses for Masters and PhD students. Students enrolled under these course numbers will have extra assignments and will be expected to do a project suitable for publication. 17-333 is a 9-unit course for undergraduate students. Masters students may register for any of the course numbers permitted by their program. This course will include a lot of reading, writing, and class discussion. Students will be able to partially tailor group projects to their skills and interests. However, all students will be expected to do some writing and some technical work. A large emphasis will be placed on research and communication skills, which will be taught throughout the course."

Please ensure you read and understand the policy below thoroughly to use it effectively. To ensure that you keep pace with the course and avoid accumulating backlogs, it's important to submit assignments on time. Assignments submitted within 48 hours after the original deadline will incur a late penalty of 20% for every 24 hours. We understand that unexpected situations can arise, be it a heavy workload, family emergencies, medical conditions, or scheduling conflicts. To accommodate these challenges, we've implemented the late pass mechanism which allows you to stagger deadlines and manage your time more flexibly. You have a total of 48 hours of late passes available for your assignments, which you can use in either of the following ways: Divide it into TWO 24-hour late passes for two different assignments, allowing submission of each up to 24 hours after the deadline without penalty. Use it as ONE 48-hour late pass for a single assignment, allowing submission up to 48 hours after the deadline without penalty. To use a late pass, you must email the teaching team (instructor and all TAs) about the type of pass you're using (24- or 48-hour pass) before the assignment deadline. We cannot accept late pass requests after an assignment's deadline. If you face extenuating circumstances after exhausting your late passes, please inform us as soon as possible. We will do our best to assist you while ensuring fairness and consistency in our submission policy for all students. Our experience shows that alerting us about potential issues at the earliest possible time allows us to explore more options. On the other hand, options for situations communicated just before or after a deadline are significantly limited, so timely communication is essential.\",\n        \"Policy on Other Assessment Components (Prep Works, Labs, and Exams)\": \"No Late Submissions\",\n        \"Details\": \"For other types of assessment components, including but not limited to prep works, labs, and exams, late submissions are not accepted unless the instructor makes a specific announcement. This policy is in place because prep works need to be done before their corresponding lectures, in-class labs require immediate completion for subsequent assignments, and exams, as high-stake assessments, require consistent submission timing for fairness and uniformity. Consequently, late passes cannot be used towards these assessment components. In case you think you may miss any of these assessment components due to extenuating circumstances, it is essential that you inform us immediately so that we may find an appropriate solution to address your special needs while ensuring fairness and consistency for all students. Again, the sooner you let us know, typically the more options we can explore.\"\n      },\n      \"Policy on Collaboration and Cheating\": {\n        \"Details\": \"Do not show your work (queries, codes, written responses, etc.) to anyone else nor look at the work of anyone else unless the person is a teaching team member. Unless otherwise announced by the teaching team, all the work you submit should reflect individual effort. You are encouraged to discuss the high-level concepts related to the assignment questions with fellow students (with the exception of quizzes and exams), but the final work product must reflect your knowledge and effort, not your classmates. You must acknowledge in your submission any help received on your assignments. That is, you must include a comment in your homework submission that clearly states the name of the book(s) and/or online source(s) from which you received assistance. Under circumstances announced by the teaching team that collaboration is allowed, you must also state the name of the student you collaborated with and/or the person(s) from which you received assistance. Cheating includes but is not necessarily limited to: Submission of work that is not your own for papers, assignments, lab exercises, or exams. Submission or use of falsified data. Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam, current or previous. Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination. Use of unauthorized material including textbooks, internet material, notes, or computer programs (including generative AI tools) in the preparation of an assignment or during an examination, unless otherwise indicated. Supplying or communicating in any way unauthorized information to another student for the preparation of an assignment or during an examination. Collaboration in the preparation of a solution to a problem unless expressly allowed by the assignment. Plagiarism which includes, but is not limited to, failure to indicate the source with quotation marks or footnotes where appropriate if any of the following are reproduced in the work submitted by a student: A graphic element. A proof. A phrase, written or musical Specific language. An idea derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another person. Program code or algorithms. If you are unsure about what is acceptable, you should consult with the instructor. Penalties for Cheating Penalties imposed are at the instructor’s discretion. In this class, the penalty imposed can be any of the following depending on the violation: zero on the assignment a letter reduction on final course grade (e.g., final grade of A- becomes B-) a failing grade in the course Regardless of the penalty imposed, all incidents of cheating are reported to the Associate Dean. Additional penalties may be imposed.\"\n      },\n      \"Recording of Class\": \"All lectures will be recorded so that students in this course (and only students in this course) can re-watch past class sessions. The recordings will be made available on Canvas typically by the end of the day on which the lecture takes place. Recordings of class sessions are covered under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and must not be shared with anyone outside your course-section. No student may record any classroom activity without express written consent from the instructor. If you have (or think you may have) a disability such that you need to record or tape classroom activities, you should contact the Office of Disability Resources to request appropriate accommodation.\"\n    },\n    \"Managing Stress and Obtaining Support\": {\n      \"Details\": \"Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. If you experience any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed.

    "ACADEMIC INTEGRITY": {
      "Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are taken extremely seriously.": "Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or assignment or as cheating on an examination, regardless of whether it is a take-home or in-class examination. The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the program. There are many other ways in which a violation can occur.",
      "Academic Dishonesty": "Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards inside and outside the classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e., plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration) is obviously discouraged and will be treated appropriately. The usual penalty for violations is a failing grade for the particular assignment in question; however, in some instances, such actions may result in a failing grade for the course. All violations will be reported to the Associate Dean in accordance with Heinz College and University policies."

If special accommodations are required, please refer to the University’s policy on accommodations and statement on student wellness and notify the instructor of any needs.",
      "ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES": "If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, discuss your accommodations and needs with the instructor as early in the semester as possible. The instructor will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, you are encouraged to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu."
    },
    "USE OF TECHNOLOGY": {
      "This semester involves regular use of technology during class – both for in-person and remote students.": "Research has shown that divided attention is detrimental to learning, so you are encouraged to close any windows not directly related to what we are doing while you are in class. Please turn off your phone notifications and limit other likely sources of technology disruption, so you can fully engage with the material, each other, and the instructor. This will create a better learning environment for everyone. Since the class sessions will be delivered synchronously in-person and remotely, a laptop will be required for our in-person classes to enable collaboration with classmates who are remote."

When a project is too complex for one person to handle, the project manager is expected to lead a team of diverse employees to complete the assignment. This course will assist the project manager to break down a complex project into manageable segments, lead a diverse project team, and use effective tools to ensure that the project meets its deliverables and is completed within budget and on schedule. Over the course of the mini, students will complete a plan for an actual project, giving them valuable experience with the relevant tools and skills, including Microsoft Project software."

However, this is a 'flipped' course format, and most lectures have been videotaped and are to be viewed asynchronously on Canvas prior to the date noted on the syllabus. Class sessions (in person at scheduled times) will be for discussion of concepts, cases, exercises, current events and providing examples of completed assignments."

    "94-813 Project Management Syllabus and Assignments Laura W. Synnott, Instructor": {
      "COURSE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND DISCUSSION BOARD POSTS": "Students are responsible for ensuring that they receive all notifications regarding the course. As such they need to go to Canvas / Account (Upper Left) / Notifications then select the checkmarks next to three areas: Announcement, Discussion and Discussion Post. There is also a Canvas app that provides notifications regarding the course.",
      "CLASS ATTENDANCE": "Attendance at classes is critical for successful completion of the course. Students will be expected to watch prerecorded lectures and download relevant course materials from Canvas prior to class. The professor frequently provides verbal explanations, clarification and instructions regarding concepts, assignments, and course deliverables during class time. Examples of project plans may also be reviewed and discussed during class. It is assumed that students will attend every class in its entirety and take notes in order to ensure that they do not miss this essential part of the course. Since students will be expected to view lectures outside of course time, there will be fewer required in-class sessions as noted on the syllabus.",
      "MICROSOFT PROJECT TUTORIAL": "By the end of this course, students are expected to have acquired basic skills with Microsoft Project, a commonly used project management software product employed in many industries. A tutorial will be held either during class or asynchronously.",
      "REQUIRED SOFTWARE": {
        "Software Programs": [

        "Instructions": "Both Miro and Microsoft Project are free for CMU students. Instructions are available on Canvas under Modules."
      },
      "ETHICAL STANDARDS": "Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards with respect to plagiarism and cheating. Neither plagiarism nor cheating will be tolerated on any exercises, quizzes, exams or assignments. Students may collaborate with others only when expressly permitted by the instructor. Students who violate academic standards will at a minimum receive a failing grade for the assignment and may also receive a failing grade for the course. Such cases will be referred to the Associate Dean, who may decide to take further action.",
      "STUDENTS MAY NOT USE GENERATIVE AI IN ANY FORM": "To best support your own learning, you should complete all graded assignments in this course yourself, without any use of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Please refrain from using AI tools to generate any content (text, video, audio, images, code, etc.) for an assignment or classroom exercise. Passing off any AI generated content as your own (e.g., cutting and pasting content into written assignments, or paraphrasing AI content) constitutes a violation of CMU’s academic integrity policy. If you have any questions about using generative AI in this course please email or talk to me.",

      "OFFICE HOURS AND QUESTIONS REGARDING THE ASSIGNMENTS": "The teaching assistants (TAs) will hold weekly office hour sessions on Zoom throughout the mini for students to ask questions about the assignments. All other questions regarding the course or assignments should be posted to the Canvas discussion board. In this way, all students will be able to review answers to other questions. All students are required to monitor the discussion board on a frequent basis to ensure that they have up to date information since the board is also used to post clarifications regarding the assignments. It is suggested that each student subscribe to each of the seven threads to be notified of posts. The instructor and the TAs will be checking the discussion board Monday-Friday and occasionally on weekends. Please note that questions received via email or phone, and last minute questions regarding an assignment will not be answered. Personal questions regarding the course should be directed to the instructor.",
      "USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES": "Laptops, tablets, cell phones and other electronic devices are not permitted in class. There are two reasons for this: Research on learning shows that unexpected noises and movement automatically divert and capture people's attention, which means you are affecting everyone’s learning experience if your cell phone, laptop, etc. makes noise or is visually distracting during class. The use of electronic devices in past sections of Project Management has demonstrated that they are too distracting for students and can have an adverse effect on class performance. There will be specific days when students will be working on assignments during class sessions, and there will be advance notice that laptops would be permitted on those days.",
      "RECORDING OF CLASS SESSIONS": "No student may record or tape any classroom activity without the express written consent of the instructor. If a student believes that he/she is disabled and needs to record or tape classroom activities, he/she should contact the Office of Equal Opportunity Services, Disability Resources to request an appropriate accommodation. For this course, I will be recording class sessions and making them available to you after classes for your personal, educational use. Recordings of class sessions are covered under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and must not be shared with anyone outside your course-section. The purpose of these recordings is so students in this course (and only students in this course) can watch or re-watch past class sessions. The recordings are not a substitute for coming to class (you won’t be able to join class remotely), and they will only become available after that day’s class sections are finished. Feel free to use the recordings if you would like to review something we discussed in class or if you are temporarily unable to attend class.",

            "Description": "Students will be asked to complete a comprehensive project plan incorporating lectures, class discussions, cases, and Microsoft Project software. Since this is the primary deliverable of the class, it is weighted the most heavily. The project plan is broken into seven assignments, worth 90% of the student grade.",
            "Project Selection": "Select a group project that has been completed and on which you worked in some capacity, and develop a Project Plan for that project. (This is not a group assignment.) Refer to sample documents on Canvas for templates of many of the required components for your Project Plan, in addition to examples given in class. Examples of appropriate projects include: a group assignment at school, a group project at work, planning an event, developing a program or training, etc. The project needs to have a minimum of 10 tasks (preferably more) and should have duration of at least two weeks. No two students can select the same project, so please check with other team members to ensure that they aren’t planning to use the same project for their assignments. It is highly recommended that you go to office hours after the first class to speak with a TA about the appropriateness of your project for the course.",
            "Assignment Grading Methodology": "Each assignment of the Project Plan will be graded according to the rubrics which are included in the second part of this document, “Project Plan Assignments.” The rubrics for each assignment outline what meets and does not meet requirements, and are used for Canvas grading. Be sure to follow the rubrics in the syllabus and make sure you complete the necessary components, then you can view the Canvas rubrics to see point distribution before you submit your assignment. All templates presented in class must be followed.",

Instead of studying AI as a purely technical subject, in this course, we will critically examine the most recent developments and deployments of AI from a social, cultural and policy perspective. Drawing upon real-world cases, this course will introduce students to the basic concepts and main topics to think AI socially, help them understand the potential benefits and pitfalls of various contemporary AI applications, and think toward future AI systems that can deliver greater social good. The course will include a mix of lectures, group discussions, guest lectures and small group in-class activities. Students will be asked to come to class having carefully read the required readings, submit response and discussion questions on Canvas respond to each other. Building on concepts and cases discussed in this class, students will also be asked to write two policy memos (one mini, one final) on the topic of their choice.",

However, your ethical responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow CMU’s academic integrity policy. Note that this policy applies to all uncited or improperly cited use of content, whether that work is created by human beings alone or in collaboration with a generative AI. If you use a generative AI tool to develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work. In practice, cutting and pasting content from any source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing content from a generative AI without citation is plagiarism.

Code generation models may produce inaccurate outputs. Image generation models may create misleading or offensive content. While you may use these tools in the work you create for this class, it is important to note that you understand you are ultimately responsible for the content that you submit. Work that is inaccurate, biased, unethical, offensive, plagiarized, or incorrect will be treated as such during the evaluation of your work."

Negotiation is not based on simple intuition. Instead, negotiation is rooted in understanding people, process, perception and presentation. This course will strive to dispel the common and pervasive belief that people are either good or bad at negotiation and little can be done about it. Some of this stems from the thought that negotiation is a zero-sum game. Together, we will work to give you the confidence to build your own reputation as a negotiator and to strengthen your practice through rehearsal, discussion and debate. You will learn critical frameworks and bargaining tactics to build alliances, strengthen interpersonal dynamics, allocate resources, balance competing interests, and resolve conflicts of all kinds. At the conclusion of this course, you will have gained critical skill-sets, techniques and communication methods to become a more complete and collaborative negotiator. You will learn how to build trust and rapport, to establish fairness and maximize value, and to apply trust-based influence in your relationships.",

All negotiations will take place in pairs with the exception of the last negotiation, which is a six party negotiation exercise. Individual preparation outside of the negotiation is required and essential. Instructions and role assignments will be published on Canvas in a class prior to the class period in which the negotiation is to be discussed. It is crucial for your learning that you spend adequate time preparing for the negotiations and post-analysis. Since we match students for the exercises, please do not accept a role assignment unless you definitively plan to participate in the negotiation exercise.

The second section should describe all parties' negotiation parameters (BATNAs, RVs, AVs, priorities, targets, underlying interests, linkage, etc). The third section should discuss the types of strategies that each side is using, how the parties might negotiation more effectively, how you expect the negotiation to be resolved, and any other type of analysis you deem relevant.",

After some preliminaries devoted to basic syntax and program structure, classes, composition, inheritance and polymorphism are examined. The Java collection classes are studied in some detail, as is the rather complex set of I/O classes. Additional topics include exception handling, building GUIs, and multi-threading. Throughout the second half of the course, a series of homework problems develops a non-toy application, illustrating by example how larger object-oriented programs are organized.",

            "1. Collaboration, using ChatGPT, CoPilot, and other AI tools": "Collaboration is permitted in Labs but not on any other assignments. Copying code without citing its source is cheating (including LLMs). Copying code from a fellow student is cheating. You may choose to use a large language model to assist with your programming work. Note that LLMs often make mistakes. You are responsible for any errors or problems that may be present in the code that you submit. The closed book exams are designed to test your knowledge and coding skills. So, if you do use a large language model, be sure to master the material and truly understand the code before taking an exam. However, your responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow the academic integrity guidelines of the university and of this class. If you use one of these generative AI tools to develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work, just as you should cite code acquired from any other source. If you copy code from the Web, be sure to provide a comment in the code with the exact URL where the code was copied from. In practice, cutting and pasting content from any source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing content from a generative AI without citation is plagiarism. Similarly, using any generative AI tool without appropriate acknowledgement will be treated as plagiarism. The university’s policy on plagiarism applies to all uncited or improperly cited use of work, whether that work is created by human beings alone or in collaboration with a generative AI. Provide as a comment in the code the exact URL where the code was copied from. Code that is provided by the instructors is allowed as long as the code is clearly cited as being provided by the instructors. Of course, if you have violated the spirit of the project, you will earn zero points. In addition to any penalties imposed by the instructor, all cheating and plagiarism infractions will be reported in writing to the Associate Dean for the program, the Associate Dean of Faculty, the Dean of Student Affairs, and the Dean. They will review and determine if expulsion should be recommended. The report will become part of the student’s record. The appropriate people to refer to for help in homework projects are the TAs and the instructors. They can look at your code and help you with it. See them during office hours.",
            "2. Videos & Self-assessments": "There is a significant part of course-content provided in the form of videos that you must watch before coming to the class each week. This will introduce you to the week's content. After watching each week’s videos before Sunday midnight, complete the weekly self-assessment based on the video-content for which you will get two attempts. The higher of the two scores will be considered for grading.",
            "3. Weekly Quiz": "There are short multiple-choice quizzes through the semester. Lowest quiz score will be dropped.",
            "4. Lab assignments": "There are lab exercises after each lecture through the semester. Each lab exercise is a short programming problem related to a topic discussed in the previous class for which you will submit a Java program before the end of the class. Lowest score will be dropped. Consider labs as a practice exam. You will have full access to all the references, but you will have to produce the final solution individually. You can consult with me, the TAs or your classmates during labs. Submissions dates and times are marked on each lab assignment, this is two days after being assigned.",
            "5. Homework": "There are 3 homework assignments and all three will be considered for your final grade. They will be due on Fridays at 11.59 PM of the week in which they are listed.",
            "6. Midterm Exams": "There are 3 mid-exams during the semester comprising questions and a programming test. Final Exam: The format of final exam is similar to mid-exams but longer and is cumulative.",
            "Others": "7. Class Attendance: As evident from all the activities listed above, labs, quizzes, and exams require your presence in the class. If you miss any lab / quiz / exam, it will be adjusted as the lowest score. No makeup lab / quiz / exam will be accepted unless there is an emergency, in which case a documented evidence may be required. Job interviews do not count as an emergency. You are expected to be present in-person in class for the labs and MUST be present for the exams. Attempts to take the exams from outside the class without instructor’s written permission will be considered as integrity violation and will be dealt with as per university policies. Grades 8. Grade disputes, if any, must be reported to the TA or the instructor within one week from the day of grade-distribution. 9. While you will have the flexibility to take help from your classmates on lab exercises, all other activities– quiz, homework, and exams – are meant to be your individual work. Copying from any source without citation, sharing your work with other students, or copying from other students will be considered as cheating and plagiarism and will be addressed according to the university policies http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/. Any violations of academic integrity in this class will have the following consequences: a. No credit for the assignment in question and lowering of the final grade by one letter (e.g. from B to C). b. In more serious offenses, failing the class. All incidents are reported to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity at Carnegie Mellon University. Additional penalties may be imposed. 10. All work must be submitted in Canvas by the due date/time. If you experience upload problems with Canvas, email me your work for grading IMMEDIATELY, AND PRIOR TO, THE DUE DATE/TIME, along with a screenshot of the upload error. When emailing me your work, I also need you to email technical information to validate the issue (type out what the error message is that you are receiving, computer information, network information, file information, date/time of attempted upload, and screenshot of error) prior to the due date/time via email to me or you will receive a 0% on the corresponding assignment. I need the error information so I can validate your excuse with Canvas administration – it must be validated by error logging. If you contact me about Canvas submission issues after the due/date time, I cannot help you. 11. Late Policy: Unless otherwise stated, no assignments will be accepted late. On the rare occasion that an assignment is announced that it can be submitted late, the assignment will be accepted with a penalty of 10% of the total worth of the assignment per day late, up to and including the late deadline announced. Do *not* ask me to make special exceptions for you and you alone – that is NOT fair to the rest of the class. NO assignments may ever be delivered by email. Please do not ask to have a Canvas assignment re-opened online for late submission. Budget for upload time to Canvas. All assignments are due by the start time of the class which it is due (unless otherwise noted)."

      "Content": "Program evaluation provides an objective basis for decision making regarding program outcomes; it is the systematic application of social science methods to assess needs for a program along with the program's design, implementation, and outcomes. It results in (1) information regarding the program’s merit, worth, or significance and (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and weaknesses of this information. Program evaluations are a critical component of determining program value. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may carry out the evaluations. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading."

      "Course Description": "Communication in written form is an essential element of management. Writing for businessfocused, industry-specific contexts differs from academic writing. Accordingly, this course focuses on teaching transferable, career-enhancing writing skills: developing essential and persuasive content, applying logic, organizing information, targeting diverse audiences with varying levels of expertise and roles, addressing feasibility, ensuring clarity, controlling tone, maintaining format norms and designing documents for readability. The course challenges students to meet readers’ needs by conveying critical thinking via anticipating the perspectives of stakeholders in professional situations. Coursework emphasizes precise, concise phrasing in actionable communications. Digital tips and strategies for collaborative writing will be discussed. Writing resources and sample documents will be provided.",

      "Registration": "Once a section is full, enrollment is dependent on: (1) the number of registered students who drop the section, and (2) the waitlist order. Students who miss the first class meeting can be automatically dropped from the course. After the initial session, registration is closed.",
      "Classroom Policies": "Professional conduct is necessary. Demonstrate respect for everyone in the room through active listening, eye contact, and productive comments. As this is a writing course, rather than a course on public policy, avoid policy debates. Further, while class is in session, refrain from: accessing personal messages, sleeping, or doing other coursework. Overall, students are expected to exhibit an interest in professional development beyond simply completing the assignments."

      "Description": "Drafts serve as preparation for individual meetings with instructor or the TA and for peer-review sessions for feedback prior to submitting the final, graded version. Further, drafts are useful for time management. Drafts are graded upon completion. Grade deductions will occur if a draft is incomplete, or if there is a lack of participation during the guided editing sessions."
    },
    "LATE ASSIGNMENT POLICY": {
      "Description": "If a student submits a paper late, the student may be jeopardizing their ability to receive comments on the first and final draft. While allotments can be made for extenuating circumstances, if the assignment is handed in late, half of a letter grade will be deducted from the overall score, for every day past the due date. For instance, if you submit an assignment two days late, then the highest grade you can receive is 90%."
    },
    "POLICY ON EXTENSIONS": {
      "Description": "Late assignments earn a failing grade unless: (1) a religious observance or a documented medical condition prevents on-time submission; and, (2) the student consulted with the instructor in advance for approval of an alternate due date."

This course will explore the origins of NoSQL databases and the characteristics that distinguish them from traditional relational database management systems. Core concepts of NoSQL databases will be presented, followed by an exploration of how different database technologies implement these core concepts. We will take a closer look at 1-2 databases from each of the four main NoSQL data models (key-value, column family, document, and graph), highlighting the business needs that drive the development and use of each database. Finally, we will present criteria that decision makers should consider when choosing between relational and non-relational databases and techniques for selecting the NoSQL database that best addresses specific use cases"

      "ACADEMIC INTEGRITY": "Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are taken extremely seriously. Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or assignment or as cheating on an examination, regardless of whether it is a take-home or in-class examination. The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the program. There are many other ways in which a violation can occur.",
      "DEADLINES AND ACCOMMODATIONS": "All assignments are due by the dates shown in this syllabus unless modified in class by the instructor. If it is anticipated that an assignment may be turned in late due to an extenuating circumstance, such as illness, contact the instructor immediately. If special accommodations are required, please refer to the University’s policy on accommodations and statement on student wellness and notify the instructor of any needs.",
      "ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES": "If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, discuss your accommodations and needs with the instructor as early in the semester as possible. The instructor will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, you are encouraged to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.",
      "USE OF TECHNOLOGY": "This semester involves regular use of technology during class – both for in-person and remote students. Research has shown that divided attention is detrimental to learning, so you are encouraged to close any windows not directly related to what we are doing while you are in class. Please turn off your phone notifications and limit other likely sources of technology disruption, so you can fully engage with the material, each other, and the instructor. This will create a better learning environment for everyone. Since the class sessions will be delivered synchronously in-person and remotely, a laptop will be required for our in-person classes to enable collaboration with classmates who are remote."

    "Negotiation: Course Summary": {
      "Content": "The same basic communication and cognitive skills that got you where you are today - advancing toward your personal and professional goals - are the ones you need to negotiate effectively. Negotiation is not based on simple intuition. Instead, negotiation is rooted in understanding people, process, perception and presentation. This course will strive to dispel the common and pervasive belief that people are either good or bad at negotiation and little can be done about it. Some of this stems from the thought that negotiation is a zero-sum game. Together, we will work to give you the confidence to build your own reputation as a negotiator and to strengthen your practice through rehearsal, discussion and debate. You will learn critical frameworks and bargaining tactics to build alliances, strengthen interpersonal dynamics, allocate resources, balance competing interests, and resolve conflicts of all kinds. At the conclusion of this course, you will have gained critical skill-sets, techniques and communication methods to become a more complete and collaborative negotiator. You will learn how to build trust and rapport, to establish fairness and maximize value, and to apply trust-based influence in your relationships.",
      "Course Objectives": {
        "Content": "Negotiation is the process by which two or more parties with interdependent interests secure agreements. This course is designed to cover the range of negotiation situations and issues faced by managers and decision makers. This course explores negotiations in many contexts; simple personal transactions, public and private sector collective bargaining, resolving disputes out of court, resolving conflicting interests within an organization, and resolving conflicting interests across organizations.",
        "Learning Objectives": [
          "Learn to identify, understand and appreciate your unique and individual negotiating style and approach. Learn to identify, adapt to and/or collaborate with competing bargaining styles.",
          "Gain the ability to analyze negotiation environments, including identifying key negotiation features and parameters.",
          "Learn to apply twelve (12) critical communication skills and techniques in a manner called trust-based influence."
        ]

      "Required and Recommended Readings": {
        "Required Textbook": "Negotiation Genius, by Malholtra and Bazerman. The text required for this course is Malhotra and Bazerman, Negotiation Genius. Excerpts from the book will be posted to Canvas for the first week of required readings, after which students will be responsible for acquiring a copy of the text. You can purchase the book on Amazon.",
        "Additional Readings": "Additional readings will be made available to you via Canvas over the course of the mini as supplemental text. Please check Canvas or reach out to jciccone@andrew.cmu.edu.",
        "Recommended Readings": [
          "Babcock & Laschever, Women Don't Ask",
          "Shell, Bargaining for Advantage",
          "Voss, Never Split the Difference"
        ],
        "Case Studies": "HBP (Harvard Business Publishing) Negotiation cases will be made available during the course of the mini and will serve as required readings ahead of in-class exercises, discussion and analysis. A course fee of approximately $18 will be charged to your student account to pay for the negotiation cases."
      },
      "Course Requirements": {
        "Negotiation Exercises": "In this course, you will participate in negotiation exercises and case studies beginning with the very first class. These exercises allow learners to develop negotiation skills experientially and to practice in a safe and forgiving environment where experimentation is welcomed. All negotiations will take place in pairs with the exception of the last negotiation, which is a six party negotiation exercise. Individual preparation outside of the negotiation is required and essential. Instructions and role assignments will be published on Canvas in a class prior to the class period in which the negotiation is to be discussed. It is crucial for your learning that you spend adequate time preparing for the negotiations and post-analysis. Since we match students for the exercises, please do not accept a role assignment unless you definitively plan to participate in the negotiation exercise. If you are unable to participate in a negotiation exercise, please notify the instructor as soon as possible so we can reassign the other impacted students: jciccone@andrew.cmu.edu.",
        "Class Participation": "Participation in the negotiation exercises and in-class discussion and analysis is critical to the success of this course. Not only will your classmates benefit from your perspective and experiences in the negotiations, but you learn to formalize your point of view more persuasively, which is an important skill for the successful negotiator. If you participate in 4 or 5 of the negotiation exercises you will receive the full 15 points to contribute to your final grade. If you participate in 3 exercises you will receive 10 points. If you participate in less than 3 exercises you will fail the course. Given that this course is a mini and negotiations are planned for classes 2 through 6, attendance and active participation will be recorded and noted for classes 2 through 6. Lecture slides, readings, supplemental readings and case studies will be made available to you via Canvas and released on select dates. Zoom office hours will be made available by appointment. Please email jciccone@andrew.cmu.edu.",
        "Preparation Plans": "You are required to submit two preparation plans (see course calendar for due dates). Plans should be concise and succinct, and thus no longer than 3 single-spaced pages, 12pt font, 1\" margins: one of several required criteria for full credit. Points will be deducted for plans that exceed the page length. All plans must be submitted in pdf format to Canvas by the start of class the day it is due. Late plans will not be accepted. Please do not email the plans: Canvas is the repository of record. The grading will focus on your ability to be clear and succinct about the salient features of the negotiation environment and their implications for the tactics and strategies you choose to employ:",
        "Analysis of Negotiation in the News": "Analyze a negotiation that is currently taking place and being reported in the news. Ideally, your analysis will focus on a public negotiation wherein you can clearly define the negotiation parameters, although exceptions with strong reference and supporting material may be available. The first section of the paper should be a complete analysis (in bullet points) of the features of the negotiation environment. The second section should describe all parties' negotiation parameters (BATNAs, RVs, AVs, priorities, targets, underlying interests, linkage, etc). The third section should discuss the types of strategies that each side is using, how the parties might negotiation more effectively, how you expect the negotiation to be resolved, and any other type of analysis you deem relevant. The assignment should not be longer than 4 single-spaced pages, 12pt font, 1\" margins: one of several required criteria for full credit. Your paper should include and cite references to support your perspective and/or tactical approach to bargaining. A fifth page may be included that contains references only. Points will be deducted for papers that exceed the page length. The analysis is due on Canvas on the date specified in the course calendar."

Without an understanding of malicious code, the risk it poses to an organization, and techniques used to undermine traditional defense measures; decision makers are ill equipped to meet threats from state sponsored and criminal elements.

        "Description": "Games have existed for almost as long as humans have walked the earth, but the video gaming industry has emerged as an economic powerhouse in recent decades. The ability to create and manipulate digital worlds completely … well, changed the game. But what differentiates a successful game from a failure? What draws people to games, and what keeps people coming back? In this short class, students will explore the basics of game design and learn how today’s most successful game developers connect a solid game design with the realities of game development in order to captivate and entertain players. This course touches on a wide variety of topics drawn from cognitive psychology, human-computer interaction, visual design, storytelling, software engineering, marketing, and the business world to paint a broad picture of the art and craft of gaming, giving students the basic ability to understand what conditions are necessary for a great game to thrive.",

    "COURSE DESCRIPTION": {
      "Description": "Communication in written form is an essential element of being a public policy professional. Writing for consulting firms, government agencies, think tanks, advocacy groups, industry associations, and other contexts in the sphere of public policy differs from academic writing. Accordingly, this course challenges students to convey critical thinking by anticipating the perspectives of stakeholders in the practice of shaping public policy. The writing skills integral to this process include: developing essential and persuasive content, communicating complex ideas, organizing information, targeting diverse audiences with varying levels of expertise and roles, ensuring clarity, controlling tone, and designing a document for readability. Students craft policy one-pagers as well as policy memos. Writing guidance and sample documents address specific topics such as public policy analysis, research, documentation, argumentation, persuasion, citation, and other mechanics. See Canvas > Modules > Grammar to review these skills. It is the responsibility of students to access and apply these resources."

This course will explore the origins of NoSQL databases and the characteristics that distinguish them from traditional relational database management systems. Core concepts of NoSQL databases will be presented, followed by an exploration of how different database technologies implement these core concepts. We will take a closer look at 1-2 databases from each of the four main NoSQL data models (key-value, column family, document, and graph), highlighting the business needs that drive the development and use of each database. Finally, we will present criteria that decision makers should consider when choosing between relational and non-relational databases and techniques for selecting the NoSQL database that best addresses specific use cases."

    "Policy on cheating and plagiarism": "This course follows Heinz School and Carnegie Mellon policies for student conduct, including policies that address inappropriate student collaboration and plagiarism. Each student is responsible for handing in their own work. For any assignment found to be the partial or complete result of cheating or plagiarism, your grade for that assignment will be zero. Cheating is defined as inappropriate collaboration among students on an assignment. This can include copying someone else’s work with or without alteration. When students are found to be collaborating in this way, BOTH will pay the penalty regardless of who originated the work.",
    "Student Wellness": "Take care of yourself, and each other! Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help."

Basic syntax and program structure, classes, composition, inheritance and polymorphism are examined. The Java collection classes are studied in some detail, as is the set of I/O classes. Additional topics include exception handling, building GUIs with JavaFX, and multi-threading. Throughout the second half of the course, a series of homework problems develops a non-toy application, illustrating by example how larger object-oriented programs are organized.",

            "Cheating Notice": "Students are subject to Carnegie Mellon University’s policies on academic integrity. You are responsible for being familiar with the university standard for academic honesty and plagiarism. Please see the CMU Student Handbook for information. In our course, there is no group assignment, and all work is individual. All your submissions must be your work. For our course, cheating means “submitting, without proper attribution, any computer code that is directly traceable to the computer code written by another person.” Copying from any source without citation, sharing your work with other students, or copying from other students will be considered as cheating and plagiarism and will be addressed according to the university policies at http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/. In general, you can use any code from the textbook and lecture notes. Other than the code you may take from textbook and lecture notes, all code you submit must be written by you. You are welcome to use generative AI tools (ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc.) in this class for certain deliverables as stated below. Although you can use them in your learning and in getting help while working on your deliverables, you cannot copy generated code from those tools and submit as your own. When working on your course deliverables, always keep in mind the following statement from CMU academic integrity policy at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academicintegrity.html: “In any manner of presentation, it is the responsibility of each student to produce [their] own original academic work.” If you are in doubt on whether to use a material in your assignment or how to use it, please consult me first. For self-assessments: You may collaborate with classmates on understanding the subjects. You may use lecture, online and AI resources. For class quizzes: No collaboration is allowed. Do not use any resource while taking the quizzes. Do not try to run the supplied code in the quizzes. For labs: While you can seek help from your classmates in labs for clarifications and debugging, you cannot copy their code and submit as your own. You may use lecture, online and AI resources. For homework assignments: You may discuss homework problems with classmates, after you have made a serious effort in trying the homework on your own. You can use ideas from the literature (with proper citation). You may use lecture, online and AI resources. For exams: No collaboration is allowed. You may use lecture, online and AI resources. To deter and detect plagiarism, tools are used in this class.",
            "Course Policies & Course Etiquette Expectations": "I expect all the students to observe polite conduct in the classroom. Specifically, please pay attention to the following:",
            "Policy Regarding Students Using English as a Foreign Language": "Assignments in this course are graded with reference to evidence of the acquisition of concepts, presentation format, and accuracy of information. Having done business in countries that use languages other than English, we understand that the use of an unfamiliar language can result in unusual word choices or grammatical errors that are not critical to the overall understanding of the information. Therefore, we will take into account your need to function in a language that may be unfamiliar to you. We will provide feedback as appropriate if we feel that language or grammar you have used in assignments would be best if it were configured in a different way.",
            "Accommodations for Students with Disabilities": "Our community values diversity and seeks to promote meaningful access to educational opportunities for all students. CMU and your instructors are committed to your success and to supporting Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended and the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990). This means that in general no individual who is otherwise qualified shall be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity, solely by reason of having a disability. If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu",
            "Classroom Expectations Related to COVID-19": "In order to attend class meetings in person, all students are expected to abide by all behaviors indicated in A Tartan’s Responsibility, including any timely updates based on the current conditions.",
            "Take Care of Yourself": "Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help."

How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights? A common problem is that we often do not know what structure underlies the data ahead of time, hence the data often being referred to as “unstructured”. This course takes a practical approach to unstructured data analysis via a two-step approach: (1) We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. (2) Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this structure to make predictions. Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations. Along the way, we encounter many of the most popular methods in analyzing unstructured data, from modern classics in manifold learning, clustering, and topic modeling to some of the latest developments in deep neural networks for analyzing text, images, and time series, including going over basics of large language models. We will be coding lots of Python and dabble a bit with GPU computing(GoogleColab).",

      "Description": "Database systems are central to most organizations’ operations. At any organizational level, users can expect to have frequent interaction with databases, and to use then to prepare useful analytics. Therefore, understanding capabilities and limitations of databases, knowing how to access data, knowing how to effectively use the information stored in such database systems, and skills in designing database systems is a distinct advantage and necessity today. The Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is the dominant type of database systems and is the primary focus of this course. This core course will cover topics such as: the relational data model (data structure, data integrity, and data manipulation), entity-relationship modelling, normalization, as well as the structured query language (for creating data structures and constraints, for managing tables’ content, and for creating a variety of queries that address business scenarios). Further, to provide students with the opportunity to apply the knowledge learnt from lectures, various homework assignments, SQL assignments, and a database implementation project will be given. TAs will be helping students from any section of the Database Management class. Complete list of TAs and their office hours will be posted on the class website (on the Contacts page).",

As research on learning shows, unexpected noises and movement automatically divert and capture people's attention. I encourage you to avoid any activity not related to class. Please turn off your phone notifications and limit other likely sources of technology disruption, so you can fully focus on the lectures. This will create a better learning environment for everyone. No student may record any classroom activity without the express written consent of the instructor. This is to protect your FERPA rights and those of your fellow students.",
        "Missed Classes": "Students are responsible for obtaining class material, which may have been discussed on days when they are absent. This can be done through the class website, by contacting a classmate who was present, or by contacting the instructor.",
        "Assignments": "Every assignment has a due date indicated in the class schedule and on the assignment document. No assignments submitted after the deadline will be accepted, unless permission is granted by the instructor prior to the due date. Late assignments, if approved, should be submitted directly to the instructor. Do not submit any late assignments to class Teaching Assistants. Each assignment must be typed, and diagrams created using PowerPoint or an equivalent tool. No collaboration in any form on assignments is allowed. It is important that the work you turn in is wholly your own. All assignments are graded by class TAs and reviewed by the instructor before they are returned to students within a week of submission. If you believe that your assignment was graded incorrectly, you may request that it be re-graded. To do this, turn in your graded assignment in question with an explanation (email to the instructor will be sufficient) within a week from the time the assignment was returned to you. The entire assignment is subject to re-grading, not just the specific item(s) in question and the grade may go up or down.",
        "Accommodations for Students with Disabilities": "If you have a disability and have an accommodation letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.",
        "Statement of Support for Students’ Health & Well-being": "Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412 – 268 – 2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.",
        "Academic Honesty & Integrity": "All CMU students are expected to follow the ethical guidelines and adhere to the policies as defined in your Program’s Student Handbook or in any other source describing such policies as they apply to students at Carnegie Mellon University. These policies and guidelines are available on the CMU website. Please read them carefully! You will be held accountable for any violations of these policies and guidelines. Collaboration or assistance on academic work to be graded is not permitted. Individual assignments must reflect individual effort. Although I expect you to attempt solving each problem on your own, I encourage you to seek help from the class TAs if you struggle with any assignment. Sharing any part of your assignments with any other student in any form (whether it is an email message, a paper document, an electronic document such as a MS Word document, or your work in any other format) is not permitted and will be considered cheating. Any “discussion” between students that results in a similar HW submission is also not allowed. In this class, the use of Generative AI tools for completing any graded class assignments is not allowed. Turning in any AI-generated material as your own, regardless of whether it is directly inserted or rephrased, is considered a violation of academic integrity. Students are expected to develop a strong understanding of database foundations and to acquire necessary proficiencies before considering enrollment in more advanced classes. Using Generative AI tools for completing assignments interferes with developing foundational database knowledge and in gaining confidence in the ability to master the needed skills.",
        "Consequences of Violations": "Any violations of academic integrity in this class will have the following consequences: a) No credit for the assignment in question and lowering final grade by one letter (e.g., from B to C), b) In more serious offences, failing the class. All incidents are reported to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity at Carnegie Mellon University. Additional penalties may be imposed."

Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or as cheating on an examination, including take- home as well as in- class examinations. The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the MEIM Program and Heinz School. Cheating includes, but is not limited to": [

The source can be a phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific language, or an idea derived from the work of another person. Note that material on the web is another person’s work and is therefore equally subject to the rules on plagiarism and cheating as any other source material. Cheating and/or plagiarism on an essay assignment will result in a failing grade (0 points) for that assignment. The essay in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the offending student’s assignments included in grade calculations; the points for that essay zero (0) will be factored into the grade. Furthermore, the cheating student’s grade shall be reduced one full letter grade. A cheating student’s final grade will be impacted significantly.

        "Course Description": "Behavioral decision making (BDM) is the study of how people make decisions in terms that can eventually help them to make better decisions. It draws together research from psychology, economics, and other fields such as marketing and management. BDM delves into the cognitive processes that underlie our choices and extends to applications that range from managing potentially hazardous technologies, to public policy for encouraging healthier behavior, to techniques for making people happier and more honest. In this course, we will cover behavioral theories of probabilistic inference, intuitive prediction, preference, and decision-making. Topics include heuristics and biases in inference, prediction, and choice; decision-making in social and moral domains; and ways to improve decision-making. We will emphasize the mutually reinforcing relationship between theory and application.",
        "Course Goals": "The overarching goal of this class is to provide a broad, though not comprehensive, survey of the field of BDM. Toward that end, I want you all to understand 1) how psychological biases, heuristics, and effects systematically impact decision-making processes and outcomes, and 2) which kinds of behavioral interventions can minimize those impacts to improve decision-making at individual and group levels. Importantly, you will learn and practice communicating your knowledge and understanding to a general audience in a variety of ways, written and verbally.",
        "Learning Objectives": {
          "1": "Identify and discuss major areas of BDM research verbally and in writing.",
          "2": "Apply theories from psychology and BDM research to explain biases in human judgment and decision-making processes and outcomes.",
          "3": "Compare scientific literature with popular press and media on BDM.",
          "4": "Use evidence from BDM research studies to explain decision-making behavior in applied social and policy-oriented issues.",
          "5": "Explain why and evaluate whether and how much behavioral interventions can minimize the systematic influence of psychological biases, heuristics, and effects on human judgment and decision-making.",
          "6": "Present decision science research in a popular press and social media-based style to communicate scientific theories and findings to an audience of the general public (All Undergraduate and Graduate Sections).",
          "7": "Propose an experiment that identifies a biased decision-making process or outcome related to your current or intended research and hypothesize an intervention to minimize the bias you identified. (Graduate Sections Only)"
        },
        "Required Learning Resources": "There are no required textbooks for this course. Throughout the course, I’ll refer to and make personal recommendations for books authored by researchers whose work we’ll cover. You will not be required to read any of those books, but they might be of interest to anyone who wants to engage with course material in a way that is more accessible to the general population outside of academia. All other required course documents will be available digitally (e.g., PDF or MS Word) on Canvas. Learning resources for the course will also include podcasts, YouTube videos, and long form journalism that are either freely available or accessible via institutional subscription via CMU. Where possible of available, podcasts will have transcripts, videos will have closed captioning or subtitles, and other readings will have audio recording."

Please see http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/ for any questions. All incidents are reported to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity at CMU. Additional penalties may be imposed.",
      "Cell Phones, Smartphones and other handheld wireless devices": "Other than during class breaks, please silence ring tones and refrain from engaging in calls, messaging or other use during class time. All devices must not be visible during quizzes.",
      "Policy Regarding Students Using English as a Foreign Language": "Assignments in this course are graded with reference to evidence of the acquisition of concepts, presentation format, and accuracy of information. Having done business in countries that use languages other than English, we understand that the use of an unfamiliar language can result in unusual word choices or grammatical errors that are not critical to the overall understanding of the information. Therefore, we will take into account your need to function in a language that may be unfamiliar to you. We will provide feedback as appropriate if we feel that language or grammar you have used in assignments would be best if it were configured in a different way.",
      "Use of Canvas System for this course": "The Heinz School uses Carnegie Mellon University’s Canvas system to facilitate distance learning as well as to enhance main campus courses. In this course, we will use the Canvas system generally to post lecture notes and related documents and to receive assignments electronically from students.",
      "Take care of yourself": "Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-2682922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help. If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night: CaPS: 412-268-2922, Re:solve Crisis Network: 888-796-8226, If the situation is life threatening, call the police: On campus: CMU Police: 412-268-2323, Off campus: 911. If you have questions about this or your coursework, please let me know."

These presentations will focus on the research process, rather than the product, as one would in a standard research seminar presentation. The faculty will address how they developed the idea; how they implemented the research, including missteps and unforeseen challenges; how they decided how to present the work; and/or how they dealt with the publication process. These presentations are intended to expose students to the very diverse members of the Heinz College faculty so that they can see whose research topics and research approaches most interest them. For each speaker, students will be expected to have carefully read the paper before class and to engage with the speaker during their guest lecture. Regular preparation and participation will determine the grading for this portion of the course.",
            "2. Student Presentations": "In the second portion of the course, students will present existing research papers to the class. The papers may be drawn from Heinz College faculty or other researchers and reflect diverse approaches to producing research that has real-world impact on policy, business, and society. Your goal is to help your classmates understand 1) what is the research question being answered by the paper, 2) why is this question important, and who benefits from answering it, and 3) what do we learn from the paper that can influence policy, business, or society more generally. These presentations will give students the opportunity to practice presenting technical research quickly and clearly to an interdisciplinary audience. The papers will help highlight the ways in which different styles of research can have real-world impact and will demonstrate how different fields emphasize different styles of research. Students will choose a paper to present, subject to my approval, and presentations will last for 30 minutes. I will be available to help with presentation preparation.",

This paper is due by the end of the second year, and the presentation to our Seminar is an important step in preparing for the formal presentation in the following semester. Your role will be to provide concise, clear, constructive feedback to each presenter within two days of the presentation.

However, doing so cannot be considered a substitute for traditional research. Generative AI programs rely on predictive models to generate content that may appear correct, but has been shown to sometimes be incomplete, inaccurate, taken without attribution from other sources, and/or biased. Any information generated by an AI program should be cited like any other reference material. You are ultimately responsible for the content of the information you submit. However, you may not attempt to pass off any work generated by an AI program as your own. Passing off any generated content as your own (for example - cutting and pasting content into written assignments, or paraphrasing AI content) constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have questions about using generative AI in this course, please talk to me.\",\n      \"Take Care of Yourself\": \"Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experience any academic stress, difficult life events, or feel anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is available to help: call 412.268.2922 and visit the website: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/ . Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.\",\n      \"Accommodations for Students with Disabilities\": \"If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.\"\n    }\n  }\n}",

      "Course Description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative AI (GenAI) are revolutionizing industries by enhancing efficiency, decisionmaking, and innovation. However, many organizations encounter significant obstacles in realizing and scaling AI's full potential. Recent surveys reveal that nearly 75% of companies struggle to achieve and scale value from AI initiatives, with approximately 70% of challenges stemming from people and process issues, 20% from technology problems, and only 10% related to AI algorithms. Furthermore, over 50% of executives express concerns about integrating GenAI into their operations, citing issues such as limited traceability and irreproducibility of outcomes, which could lead to suboptimal or even illegal decision-making. This course is designed to tackle these challenges head-on, providing graduate-level students with a comprehensive understanding of the AI lifecycle. Students will learn how to navigate the complex process of identifying which business tasks should be automated through AI and which decisions should be augmented using AI. The course introduces practical frameworks essential for making these strategic decisions and successfully implementing AI solutions. Throughout the course, students will engage deeply with each stage of the AI lifecycle. They will learn to identify and prioritize high-impact AI use cases, conduct thorough cost-benefit analyses, and design strategic roadmaps aimed at maximizing return on investment (ROI). The curriculum blends theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience using industry-standard tools such as Jupyter Lab, Docker, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Kafka, and Evidently. These tools are critical for overcoming the common pitfalls associated with AI deployment and preparing students to scale AI systems in real-world environments. The course’s practical orientation is further enhanced through case studies that serve as a foundation for class discussions. These case studies provide students with the opportunity to analyze real-world AI applications, assess the challenges involved, and understand the decision-making processes behind successful implementations. Additionally, two guest lectures from seasoned industry practitioners will offer firsthand insights into the practical challenges of AI deployment across various sectors. A strong emphasis is placed on governance and trust, equipping students with the knowledge to develop ethical, transparent, and effective AI systems. Students will learn how to integrate AI into organizational processes, assess talent and skill gaps, and create strategies to build the necessary capabilities for sustained AI-driven innovation. This course is essential for students aspiring to careers as AI engineers, AI analysts, or AI governance experts. It is equally invaluable for business and technology students who wish to understand how to manage the development and deployment of AI systems. By the end of the course, students will possess a well-rounded, practical understanding of AI system management, enabling them to lead AI-driven projects and drive innovation across industries.",

In this course, we will cover analytic techniques such as clustering, classification, and anomaly detection, in the context of their applicability to the information security domain. We will explore the data sources that can be mined for security information. We will use hands-on labs to provide practical experience applying analytic techniques to these data sources. Finally, we will present strategies that can be used ensure the outputs of information security analytics are accurate, understandable, and actionable by security practitioners and business decision makers alike."

There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/.

Its objective is to provide individuals who aspire to enter management or policy analysis positions with the basic statistical tools for analyzing and interpreting data. For students intending to take more advanced courses in statistics and machine learning its purpose is also to ensure that you are well grounded in the fundamentals of statistics. The course is divided into three distinct modules: descriptive statistics, statistical inference, and regression analysis. The emphasis of the lectures on descriptive statistics is the calculation and interpretation of summary statistical measures and graphical methods for describing raw data. The sessions on statistical inference are designed to provide you with the background for executing and interpreting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. The final component of the course focuses on regression analysis, a widely used statistical methodology. Throughout the course you will regularly analyze data relevant to management and policy analysis using a statistical platform developed here at CMU called ISLE.\",\n    \"Instructors\": {\n      \"Eli Ben-Michael\": {\n        \"Email\": \"ebenmichael@cmu.edu\",\n        \"Office hours\": \"10am – 11am Monday and 2pm – 3pm Tuesday.

See course policies below.\"\n      },\n      \"Grading Philosophy and Procedures\": \"My goal is to prepare you to be quantitatively minded decision-makers and technical practitioners. The ILOs are designed to reflect these goals, and grading will be geared towards attainment of the ILOs. Homework and exam solutions will be posted with rubrics to explain point attribution. If you believe your assignment has a grading error, you must submit a regrade request in Gradescope within three days of grade release. You must accompany the request with a clear and specific written explanation.\"\n    },\n    \"Course Expectations and Policies\": {\n      \"Lecture Attendance\": \"I expect all students to attend lectures in person—and actively participate—but you will have 2 “free pass” absences to be flexible to unexpected conflicts; no reason required. Attendance will be logged through in-class question forms that you’ll fill out at the end of each class. These will serve primarily as a pulse check for me to see where the class stands and adjust accordingly. These questions will be graded for completion, not correctness—it is a way for you to stay actively engaged with the course content.\",\n      \"Recitations\": \"Friday recitations will be hosted by your fantastic TA team. The content will vary by week, including lecture content review, in-class cases, and exams. In-person attendance is mandatory on exam and case days. Recitation will not be required on the weeks when there is no case or exam, but attendance is strongly encouraged. The recitations will allow you to do hands-on exercises, work collaboratively, and ask questions. You must attend your assigned recitation time (either B3 or C3); both sections are at capacity.\",\n      \"Homework Assignments\": \"Homework assignments will be due on Wednesdays (by midnight) via Gradescope and will generally cover the previous week’s lecture material. We will not accept late assignments, but the lowest grade across all homework assignments will be automatically dropped. You do not need to submit all five homework assignments – if you do not submit one, it will by default be the dropped assignment.\",\n      \"In-class Cases\": \"There will be two cases in recitation, which are meant to be low-stakes opportunities to put the course material into practice, honing your Excel skills and managerial interpretation of the results. These two recitations will have mandatory in-person attendance.\",\n      \"Exams\": \"Both exams will occur in class. The exams will be closed book, but you will be allowed a “crib sheet”: one 8.5 x 11” handwritten sheet – one-sided for the first exam, and two-sided for the second exam. There will be no makeup exams offered, pending extraordinary circumstances. You can bring a standard calculator to the exam.\"\n    },\n    \"Course Expectations and Policies Continued\": {\n      \"Unforeseen Circumstances\": \"The past years have shown us new levels of uncertainty; there is a limit to how robust our plans can be! If unusual circumstances arise, health-wise or otherwise, please let me know immediately. I will aim to accommodate your needs (within reason), and we can work together to make a plan that allows you to succeed in this class.\",\n      \"Lecture Recording\": \"We will record the lectures through Zoom and will post them on Canvas within 24 hours of each lecture. Note that the videos are intended solely for your personal educational use; they may not be shared with anyone outside of your course section (including students who enroll in the course in future semesters). Unauthorized sharing of the videos violates the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Students may not record lectures.\",\n      \"Special Accommodations and Disability Resources\": \"If you require disability-related accommodations, I encourage you to reach out to me early in the semester. If you need an accommodations letter from the Office of Disability Resources, please contact the office at access@andrew.cmu.edu. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate.\",\n      \"Academic Integrity Statement\": \"In this course, I will hold you to the high academic integrity standard expected of all CMU students. I do this for two reasons. First, it is essential to the learning process that you are the one doing the work. I have structured the assignments in this course to enable you to master the course material. Failing to do the work yourself will result in a lesser understanding of the content and, therefore, a less meaningful education for you. Second, it is important that there be a level playing field for all students in this course and in the College so that the rigor and integrity of Heinz’s educational program is maintained.\"\n    },\n    \"Course Expectations and Policies Continued 2\": {\n      \"Generative AI Tools Policy\": {\n        \"Usage\": \"Generative AI tools can be used to support general learning or ungraded exercises, such as brainstorming or reviewing general principles. Please let me know if you use AI tools for these purposes! I would be eager to engage with any of you on this to get your perspective on where AI is useful and its opportunities/pitfalls.\",\n        \"Restrictions\": \"AI tools should not be used for any graded assignments unless explicitly allowed. GenAI cannot be considered a substitute for developing the fundamental skills and expertise represented by the learning objectives of this course. Please note that these tools rely on predictive models to generate content that may appear correct, but has been shown to sometimes be incomplete, inaccurate, taken without attribution from other sources, and/or biased. You are ultimately responsible for the content of the information you submit and may not attempt to pass off any work generated by an AI program as your own.\"\n      },\n      \"Inclusivity Statement\": \"I value an inclusive environment, as does the broader CMU community. I strongly believe that a culture that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion benefits all of us—it creates a better environment to work and study, and it unlocks creativity and innovation to make us better problem-solvers. With this in mind, I hope to foster a sense of community in this classroom and consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect. We welcome individuals of all backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, national origins, gender identities, sexual orientations, religious and political affiliations – and other visible and nonvisible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for every other class member. This is our shared responsibility. If this standard is not being upheld, please feel free to speak with me.\",\n      \"Reporting Resources\": \"Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They create an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or witnesses discrimination to speak out for justice and support their colleagues. Anyone can share these experiences anonymously using the Ethics Reporting Hotline (844-587-0793; cmu.ethicspoint.com). Additionally, the Title IX office is dedicated to promoting gender equity at Carnegie Mellon University, which includes coordinating the University's efforts to prevent and effectively respond to all forms of gender discrimination (including gender identity discrimination) and sexual misconduct impacting community members, including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, dating and domestic violence, and stalking.\"\n    },\n    \"Student Wellness Statement\": {\n      \"Support\": \"First off, please take care of yourself! School is important, but it’s not the only priority – take breaks, find stress relievers, and get rest. Finding balance will help your quality of life and make you a better student. You will work best when you bring your whole self and energy to class. All of us struggle, and all of us can benefit from help in those times. As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating, and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may impact your ability to attend class, focus, complete work, take an exam, or participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus at: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412268-2922.\",\n      \"Emergency Contacts\": [\n        {\n          \"Organization\": \"CaPS\",\n          \"Phone\": \"412-268-2922\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Organization\": \"Re:solve Crisis Network\",\n          \"Phone\": \"888-796-8226\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Organization\": \"Police\",\n          \"Phone\": \"412-268-2323 (CMU) or 911 (off-campus)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"Other resources\": {\n      \"Student Academic Success Center (SASC)\": {\n        \"Programs\": [\n          {\n            \"Name\": \"Academic coaching\",\n            \"Description\": \"This program provides holistic, one-on-one peer support and group workshops to help students implement habits for success.

Email the CMU Food Pantry Coordinator to schedule an appointment (412-268-8704 (SLICE office); cmupantry@andrew.cmu.edu).\"\n    },\n    \"Tips for success\": \"This class will move quickly – we have a lot to cover in seven weeks! I strongly encourage you to do the pre-readings assigned before each lecture, since this will make the lecture content much more digestible. Additionally, the most useful part of the class will be hands-on learning through case studies and homework assignments, so please take the time to get “in the weeds” with all exercises, even if you are working in a group for homework or case. This is where you get to apply the class material and see its practical value. The class will also use Excel extensively. Don’t worry too much about Excel mechanics during lectures. I will run through examples to show you what can be done, but recitation and office hours will be better places to work through Excel questions. There is also a ton of Excel content online, so Google will be your quickest resource if you run into spreadsheet bugs. If you feel like you are falling behind at any point, my door is open. I encourage you to stop by office hours discuss assignments, questions from lecture, or anything else (related to school or otherwise!); I look forward to seeing you! You can also set up time to meet 1:1 to discuss specific issues with me. Finally, Heinz has tutoring resources available to support your academic success – I am happy to connect you with a tutor as needed.\"\n  }\n}",

      "Course Description": "The 2020 election was the culmination of years of intensified debates and legal battles over voting rights, election procedures, and regulations. These events highlighted uncomfortable questions about the state and nature of U.S. elections and amplified them to a new level. Are U.S. elections fair? Who can run for office? Do all Americans have access to their right to vote? Are elections subject to external interference? Furthermore, is the system broken, and if so, how can we fix it? This class will consider these questions and more as we work to explore U.S. elections. We will take the U.S. Constitution and federal and state laws as a baseline and consider the legal and societal factors that influence the workings of the U.S. electoral system. This course will touch on topics such as voting laws, campaign finance, disinformation, and democratic erosion. Through this process, we will confront the challenges facing the U.S. electoral system and explore pathways forward for the future of democracy in the United States."

Additional information and requirements for this project will be posted on Canvas by September 24th at 11:59 pm, and the project will be due on October 9th at 11:59 pm. The goal of this assignment is to build your skills in identifying and summarizing a problem, presenting potential solutions, and recommending a solution to others. Please write your paper with changes tracked in Google Docs.",
        "Redistricting Presentation": "In groups of 3-4 students, you will work to redistrict a state of your choosing with at least 10 congressional districts. As a group, you will need to (1) identify the current electoral districts and redistricting policy in your chosen state, (2) determine a specific goal for your redistricting process (partisan balance, increased minority representation, etc.), (3) use available software to create new district boundaries that align with these goals, (4) compare and contrast your districts with current districts, (5) outline how your new districts affect representation, and (6) identify any lessons learned. Your redistricting process can be as complicated as using available data and algorithms to create your districts or as simple as hand-selecting your districts in a program like District Builder. Prepare a 15- to 20-minute class presentation on this process using either a PowerPoint or class handouts on your redistricting process. Slides or class handouts should be submitted 48 hours before your presentation date. The instructor will review the presentation materials to ensure that they are effective. Additional guidelines will be provided on Canvas.",
        "Extra Credit – Civic Engagement Activity": "First-hand experience and civic engagement provide an insight into American politics that I can never replicate in a course setting or simulation. That said, I am cognizant of various barriers that would make a formal assignment requiring participation unfair. To encourage such participation, I’m offering up to 3 percent extra credit not to exceed a final course grade of more than 100% for any student that: (1) Participates in volunteer work or interacts with a non-profit, government agency, grassroots organization, or election. These activities include but are not limited to going to a local government town hall, volunteering as a poll worker, attending a campaign event, watching a congressional hearing online, or even watching past campaign rallies on YouTube. To complete this activity, you do not need to participate in a partisan or government-sponsored event. Just make sure you can find some link between the activity and elections. If an online option is chosen, the engagement must be equivalent to the time it would take to attend a meeting in person (at least 1 hour in length). (2) Writes a 500-word (approximately 1 page double spaced) reflection on your experience, tying what you learned to a concept studied in our class. Details for this assignment will be on Canvas, including formatting expectations. This paper must be completed and submitted by 11:59 pm on the Saturday after the final day of class (October 12th)."

    "Course Policies": {
      "Make-up and Late work policy": "Due dates for every assignment are provided in the course syllabus and posted on Canvas. Unless otherwise stated, assignments are due on those days. However, I recognize that sometimes “life happens.” In these instances, you are allotted one flex day for use during the semester. This day allows you to submit one assignment one day late without penalty. You can use this day for any reason. You do not need to provide me with the explanation: simply email me and tell me you would like to use your flex day and include this information at the top of your submitted assignment. Flex dates cannot be used for group assignments or presentations as these assignments are tied to specific dates in the class schedule. Once you’ve exhausted your flex day, point deductions will occur for any assignment submitted after the deadline. A late assignment submitted within 24 hours of the due date will only be eligible for 80% of the maximum points allotted. From 24-48 hours after the deadline, assignments will be eligible for 60% of the maximum points allotted. Assignments submitted more than 48 hours after the due date (+ any flex dates) will not be accepted. Please let me know if you experience extenuating circumstances (e.g., you are hospitalized) that prohibit you from submitting your assignments on time. I will evaluate these instances on a case-by-case basis and may require documentation.",
      "Attendance and participation policy": "Attendance for this course is mandatory. Course Discussions ensure that you learn not just from your instructor but also from your peers. Each student who stays home from class or does not contribute is a lost perspective and a counterpoint that could have been raised. Attendance means more than physical proximity in the classroom. You should make at least one meaningful contribution to a small group discussion, activity, or class discussion in each class. Please come to class prepared, having read, viewed, or listened to the assigned materials.",
      "Email policy": "Email is the best way to contact me outside class. My email address is listed at the top of this syllabus. I will do my best to respond to weekday emails within 24 hours. Messages received after 6 pm will be answered the next day, and emails received on weekends will be answered by the following Monday. Many students send emails with questions near assignment due dates. I can only guarantee that your questions will be answered if you email at least one workday before deadlines.",
      "Re-grade policy": "I will strive to assign grades that fairly and accurately reflect the quality of the work you submit. I will only re-grade assignments if the change has the potential to affect your final grade. Any requests for re-grades must be submitted to me in writing within one week of receiving your graded work back, and you must explain in writing why you feel your grade was inappropriate. Regrades can result in raising or lowering your initial grade.",
      "Recording Classes": "No student may record classroom activity without my written consent. We discuss sensitive topics in class, and each student should feel comfortable contributing. That said, if you have (or think you may have) a disability such that you need to record or tape classroom activities, please contact the Office of Disability Resources to request an appropriate accommodation.",
      "Academic Integrity & Collaboration": "Honesty and transparency are important features of good scholarship. Conversely, plagiarism and cheating are serious academic offenses with serious consequences. If you are discovered engaging in either behavior in this course, you will earn a failing grade on the assignment in question, and further disciplinary action will be taken. For a clear description of what counts as plagiarism, cheating, and/or the use of unauthorized sources and tools, please see the University’s Policy on Academic Integrity (revised in April 2013): https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academicintegrity.html I encourage you to use campus resources like the Student Academic Success Center (SASC) to assist you in your pursuit of academic excellence. However, please note that in accordance with the university’s policy, you must acknowledge any collaboration or assistance that you receive on work that is to be graded, either from a person, reference, or a tool (including tools like Grammarly). So, when you turn in any assignments, please include a sentence at the end that says either: “I worked alone on this assignment.”, or “I worked with __________ [person or tool] on this assignment.” and/or “I received assistance from _________ [person or tool] on this assignment.” Providing this information will not impact your grade and will only serve to help me understand you better. If you have questions about my integration of the university’s policy into this course, please do not hesitate to ask. I aim to foster an environment where you can learn and grow while ensuring that the work we all do is honest and fair.

      "Use of Artificial Intelligence/Chat GPT": "Assignments in this course are designed to improve your communication skills and ability to apply class concepts in your arguments. I also hope written assignments from this class can be used as writing samples for job applications. To best support your learning and future career development, you may not use generative AI tools to build the arguments in your paper or write any component of your project, including brainstorming topics. These activities are essential for developing the fundamental skills and expertise represented by the learning objectives of this course. Generative AI tools rely on probabilistic models to generate content, which may sometimes be incomplete, inaccurate, unoriginal, or biased. I have even seen AI plagiarizing content without a student’s knowledge. An AI tool should not be considered a substitute for traditional approaches to research. You are ultimately responsible for the content of the information you submit and may not attempt to pass off work generated by an AI program as your own. All written submissions must be submitted with changes tracked. Passing off any AI-generated content as your own (e.g., cutting and pasting content into written assignments, paraphrasing AI content, or using AI to brainstorm your paper topic) constitutes a violation of CMU’s academic integrity policy. However, there is one major exception. Generative AI is a powerful tool for gaining feedback on the quality of your paper and identifying strengths and weaknesses before submitting final drafts. In this spirit, you may use generative AI tools to obtain feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of your paper. This feedback can help you identify areas for improvement in your writing. As an important line, this process will be considered academic dishonesty if generative AI changes your paper’s text or re-writes your thesis, argument, or examples. You must implement any recommendations made on your own. An example of an appropriate prompt is provided here. If you choose to use generative AI in this spirit, you must cite the generative AI platform used and submit a log of prompts you use when interacting with generative AI. If you have any questions about using generative AI in this course, please email or talk to me."

        "Course Description": "This class will provide an introduction to coding in R, a widely used statistical programming language. Students will learn to import, export, and manipulate datasets with different data types. Students will analyze the datasets using common statistical methods. For example, they will design, construct, and interpret statistical models and produce a variety of different customized graphical outputs. Throughout the course, students will create scripts and generate reproducible reports. There will be a focus on using these tools in public policy areas through examples and a class project. The format for this course will be a combination of weekly lectures and interactive in-class activities that will allow students to practice the material taught. At the end of the course, you will be able to understand coding structures and create your own code. The project will allow you to identify and develop an analytical model that contributes to policy design, and communicate your result to a technical and non-technical audience. A good knowledge of statistics is preferred, but this course is for anyone wanting to learn the basics of the R language and how to use the tools R offers to be able to do basic data analysis, statistical calculations, create graphical output, and generate reproducible reports using R Markdown.",
        "Course Objectives": {
          "At the end of this course, you should be able to": [
            "Understand and reproduce coding structures.",
            "Use R with RStudio, find and understand R documentation, and write functional scripts.",
            "Produce statistical summaries of continuous and categorical data.",
            "Produce basic graphics and advanced graphics using different packages.",
            "Perform basic statistical and hypothesis tests.",
            "Develop classification and regression models and interpret the results.",

        "Class expectations": {
          "Attendance": "Class attendance is mandatory. Students may miss two lectures with no penalty. If you anticipate more absences, please speak with me as early as possible. The best way to learn R is by creating code, making mistakes, and finding ways to produce results. Lectures will be interactive with students encouraged to use their laptops/computers to connect and participate in the course as well as run R code and follow along with real-time exercises. We will work on simple example problems that will help you understand the material. If you miss a class, you are responsible for checking the lecture slides/notes on Canvas and obtaining any additional class material from another student or me. You can request the material from me through email or in person at office hours. Beware that the material of this course is cumulative. Thus, catching up on time will allow you to follow up in the classes following the one you missed. If you miss a class the day an assignment is due, please make sure you make prearranged plans to submit the assignment on time and prevent points being deducted. The late assignment policy can be found in the Assessment section of this syllabus.",
          "Classroom behavior": "Please arrive on time. If you arrive after the class has started, please enter quietly to avoid distracting other students and interrupting the lecture. Laptops, and iPads are permitted in class for taking notes or for class activities. Please refrain from using cellphones or electronics for other purposes during class. This might distract other students and keep you from fully understanding the material.",
          "Participation": "The class is going to be a combination of lectures and in-class activities. Participation is highly encouraged to keep the class interactive. All questions are good questions. You are all here to learn and your question might help other students. We are all responsible for creating a safe and collaborative learning environment. For doing so, I expect you to respect each other's learning process.",
          "Communication": "If you need to communicate with me, please come to my office hours or send me an email. If you have time conflicts with my office hours, email me and we can arrange another time to meet. I am committed to replying to your emails within 24 hours on weekdays."
        },
        "Assessment": {
          "In-class activities - follow along": "During lecture time, students will be expected to follow along with the exercise demonstrated in class. While follow-alongs are meant to be finished during class time, students will have until the next day to submit their work. That is, if the follow-along is on a Tuesday, you have until Wednesday at midnight to submit your work, if the follow-along is on a Thursday, you have until Friday at midnight to submit your work. This allows students to have more time to complete the follow-along, accounting for the fact that they might sometimes experience technical difficulties during class, fall behind in the demonstration, or need more time to refine their work. These hands-on exercises are a great way to build up the practical experience you’ll then require for your case study challenge and final projects.",
          "In-class activities - case studies": "To gain hands-on learning experience, we will work on in-class case studies. Some of these case studies will have an individual deliverable, and some will have a group deliverable. These assignments are designed to help students practice and apply class content through small challenges. Students will work with others in randomly assigned groups to complete the case study. Students will be able to access a solution after the case studies have been submitted. Class activities are meant to be finished in class; by the end of class, you should submit your work regardless of how much is completed.",
          "Quizzes": "There will be 2 short quizzes scheduled on Week 3 and Week 6. The purpose of these quizzes is to assess understanding of various concepts that are central to the class.",
          "Project": "The final project for the class will ask you to explore a broad policy question using a large publicly available dataset of your choosing. This project is intended to provide students with the complete experience of going from a study question and a rich data set to a full statistical report. Students will be expected to (a) explore the data to identify important variables, (b) perform statistical analyses to address the policy question, (c) produce tabular and graphical summaries to support their findings, and (d) write a report describing their methodological approach, findings, and limitations. To help you with the project process and load you will have weekly assignments. These assignments will allow us to guide you throughout the course of your project and answer any questions along the way. You can find a detailed project description on Canvas. While students may work in small groups to decide on appropriate statistical methodology and graphical/tabular summaries, each student will be required to produce and submit their own code and final report.",
          "Class participation": "Participation will be graded based on attendance and participation in class activities. This includes but is not limited to questions asked in class, completing class activities, being engaged with the class discussion. To make the class interactive, I expect all of you to come prepared to class, engage in class discussions, and share your results from class activities.",
          "Regrade policy": "We are committed to returning work to you as quickly as possible. Our goal is to grade assignments and return them within 1 week of the due date. Graded assignments will be available for pickup at the recitation sessions and at the end of the lectures. All appeals for grading must be made within 2 weeks of the due date of the assignments. The appeal must be written and include the number of the question with the specific reason why you believe the grade is incorrect. You must submit the original graded paper with the written appeal to one of the TA’s after class or during office hours. Please check the homework solution before appealing.",
          "Late assignments": "You can submit one late assignment, up to 24 hours after the deadline, without penalization. After your first late assignment, each additional late assignment will have a deduction of 20% of the points. That is, in your second late assignment you will only be eligible for 80% of the total grade, in the third late assignment you will only be eligible for 60% of the points, and so on. Assignments cannot be submitted more than 24 hours after the deadline. Any assignment submitted more than 24 hours after the deadline will have a grade of zero. However, I understand occasional emergencies can happen, so please notify me as soon as possible and we can make arrangements for your submission. A late assignment due to an emergency will not count toward the late assignment policy."

If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.",
        "Well being": "Graduate school can be challenging at times. Make sure to take time for yourself and do activities you enjoy. The University Provost provides the following thoughts that I believe are important to share: Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.",
        "Inclusion and Diversity": "We must treat every individual with respect. We at Heinz College are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Inclusion is ensuring everyone feels respected in the environments they interact with others. Diversity can be broadly defined as the presence of people who identify with multiple attributes, these include but are not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. I will work to promote and create an inclusive and equitable learning environment. I understand that diverse backgrounds require different learning tools and I am committed to provide each of you with the tools you need to grow and learn in my class. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. The university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources: Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150, Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a report by calling 844-587-0793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com. All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.",

Yet, despite its potential, many AI projects face significant hurdles in deployment. According to a recent survey, only 22% of data scientists report that their 'revolutionary' AI initiatives—those designed to enable new processes or capabilities—usually reach deployment. Alarmingly, 43% say that 80% or more of their AI projects fail to make it into production. Even when considering all types of machine learning projects, including those focused on refreshing existing models, only 32% of models typically deploy. These statistics underscore the critical challenges of scaling AI systems effectively. This course is designed to tackle these challenges head-on, providing graduate-level students with a comprehensive understanding of the AI lifecycle. Students will learn how to navigate the complex process of identifying which business tasks should be automated through AI and which decisions should be augmented using AI. The course introduces practical frameworks essential for making these strategic decisions and successfully implementing AI solutions. Throughout the course, students will engage deeply with each stage of the AI lifecycle. They will learn to identify and prioritize high-impact AI use cases, conduct thorough cost-benefit analyses, and design strategic roadmaps aimed at maximizing return on investment (ROI). The curriculum blends theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience using industry-standard tools such as Jupyter Lab, Docker, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Kafka, and Evidently. These tools are critical for overcoming the common pitfalls associated with AI deployment and preparing students to scale AI systems in real-world environments. The course’s practical orientation is further enhanced through case studies that serve as a foundation for class discussions. These case studies provide students with the opportunity to analyze real-world AI applications, assess the challenges involved, and understand the decision-making processes behind successful implementations. Additionally, two guest lectures from seasoned industry practitioners will offer firsthand insights into the practical challenges of AI deployment across various sectors. A strong emphasis is placed on governance and trust, equipping students with the knowledge to develop ethical, transparent, and effective AI systems. Students will learn how to integrate AI into organizational processes, assess talent and skill gaps, and create strategies to build the necessary capabilities for sustained AI-driven innovation. This course is essential for students aspiring to careers as AI engineers, AI analysts, or AI governance experts. It is equally invaluable for business and technology students who wish to understand how to manage the development and deployment of AI systems. By the end of the course, students will possess a well-rounded, practical understanding of AI system management, enabling them to lead AI-driven projects and drive innovation across industries.\",\n    \"Learning Objectives\": {\n      \"1.

      "Description": "Database systems are central to most organizations’ operations. At any organizational level, users can expect to have frequent interaction with databases, and to use then to prepare useful analytics. Therefore, understanding capabilities and limitations of databases, knowing how to access data, knowing how to effectively use the information stored in such database systems, and skills in designing database systems is a distinct advantage and necessity today. The Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is the dominant type of database systems and is the primary focus of this course. This core course will cover topics such as: the relational data model (data structure, data integrity, and data manipulation), entity-relationship modelling, normalization, as well as the structured query language (for creating data structures and constraints, for managing tables’ content, and for creating a variety of queries that address business scenarios). Further, to provide students with the opportunity to apply the knowledge learnt from lectures, various homework assignments, SQL assignments, and a database implementation project will be given. TAs will be helping students from any section of the Database Management class. Complete list of TAs and their office hours will be posted on the class website (on the Contacts page).",

        "Lectures & Expectations": "While no attendance will be taken, it is in your interest to attend each lecture. Class participation is encouraged and expected. As research on learning shows, unexpected noises and movement automatically divert and capture people's attention. I encourage you to avoid any activity not related to class. Please turn off your phone notifications and limit other likely sources of technology disruption, so you can fully focus on the lectures. This will create a better learning environment for everyone. No student may record any classroom activity without the express written consent of the instructor. This is to protect your FERPA rights and those of your fellow students.",
        "Missed Classes": "Students are responsible for obtaining class material, which may have been discussed on days when they are absent. This can be done through the class website, by contacting a classmate who was present, or by contacting the instructor.",
        "Assignments": "Every assignment has a due date indicated in the class schedule and on the assignment document. No assignments submitted after the deadline will be accepted, unless permission is granted by the instructor prior to the due date. Late assignments, if approved, should be submitted directly to the instructor. Do not submit any late assignments to class Teaching Assistants. Each assignment must be typed, and diagrams created using PowerPoint or an equivalent tool. No collaboration in any form on assignments is allowed. It is important that the work you turn in is wholly your own. All assignments are graded by class TAs and reviewed by the instructor before they are returned to students within a week of submission. If you believe that your assignment was graded incorrectly, you may request that it be re-graded. To do this, turn in your graded assignment in question with an explanation (email to the instructor will be sufficient) within a week from the time the assignment was returned to you. The entire assignment is subject to re-grading, not just the specific item(s) in question and the grade may go up or down.",
        "Accommodations for Students with Disabilities": "If you have a disability and have an accommodation letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.",
        "Statement of Support for Students’ Health & Well-being": "Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412 – 268 – 2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.",
        "Academic Honesty & Integrity": "All CMU students are expected to follow the ethical guidelines and adhere to the policies as defined in your Program’s Student Handbook or in any other source describing such policies as they apply to students at Carnegie Mellon University. These policies and guidelines are available on the CMU website. Please read them carefully! You will be held accountable for any violations of these policies and guidelines. Collaboration or assistance on academic work to be graded is not permitted. Individual assignments must reflect individual effort. Although I expect you to attempt solving each problem on your own, I encourage you to seek help from the class TAs if you struggle with any assignment. Sharing any part of your assignments with any other student in any form (whether it is an email message, a paper document, an electronic document such as a MS Word document, or your work in any other format) is not permitted and will be considered cheating. Any “discussion” between students that results in a similar HW submission is also not allowed. In this class, the use of Generative AI tools for completing any graded class assignments is not allowed. Turning in any AI-generated material as your own, regardless of whether it is directly inserted or rephrased, is considered a violation of academic integrity. Students are expected to develop a strong understanding of database foundations and to acquire necessary proficiencies before considering enrollment in more advanced classes. Using Generative AI tools for completing assignments interferes with developing foundational database knowledge and in gaining confidence in the ability to master the needed skills.",
        "Consequences of Violations": "Any violations of academic integrity in this class will have the following consequences: a) No credit for the assignment in question and lowering final grade by one letter (e.g., from B to C), b) In more serious offences, failing the class. All incidents are reported to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity at Carnegie Mellon University. Additional penalties may be imposed."

      "Course Description": "This course introduces the distinctive qualities of American philanthropy, and explores the roles and responsibilities you will have as a professional fundraiser, leader, or as a staff member in a non-profit arts organization. In this fundamentals course the focus is on individual donors - their motivations, sources of contributed funds, and new and emerging fundraising techniques, although we will also explore the broad philanthropic landscape as a whole. Additional topics include legal requirements and ethical considerations that are important to fundraising, effective data management and its effects on the success of your fundraising efforts, solicitation strategies and effective communication with donors, and the principles of donor centered fundraising. We will explore the idea of a nonprofit environment in transition, an environment where the fields of arts and culture compete with social services, education, and global philanthropic needs for a limited pool of dollars; where we are under increasing pressure to make the case for relevance and civic stature; where our funders - whether individual philanthropists, foundations, corporations, or government - have changing and higher expectations around both involvement and accountability."

    "Course Syllabus": {
      "Course Description": "In this course, we will be studying useful probability/statistical models that can be applied in business practice to perform consumer behavior analysis. In particular, we will focus on two key aspects of user (or product) behavior: timing process and counting process. The former will focus on the timing of a user doing something (when will a user churn from a firm, when will a product drop out of bestseller list, when will a user adopt a new product, and so on). The latter will focus on how many items are purchased or how many users are adopting and so on. Time permitting, we will also introduce choice process (out of a number of choices, which product is chosen). We will also examine issues of sales concentration and models of long tail using these processes. With each lecture, we will be using real world datasets to apply the learning in lectures to a practical problem facing a manager. Students will store datasets and retrieve the relevant information before any analysis can be performed. By the end of course, students are expected to be able to 1. identify the appropriate mathematical model for the consumer behavior under study (survival model, count model, etc.) 2. build the model of consumer behavior, 3. apply the model to data to test the accuracy and perform necessary tweaks, and 4. based on the model constructed, predict outcome change in response to firm strategy",
      "Textbook": "No required textbook for this course. Lecture slides and reading materials will be posted along the line.",

        "Part I": "First, we will post lecturer videos and slides beforehand. Lecture videos are usually uploaded by the end of Sundays and Wednesdays. Video links will be posted under each lecture module. You will need your Andrew ID and Password to log onto the system to watch the videos. Along with each video, I will also provide a short documentation to help you better catch the key points of the lecture. You are required to watch the lecture videos before each recitation.",
        "Part II": "I will conduct weekly recitations to review the important points covered in the lecture videos, go through practice problems, and answer your questions. The focus will be on the application. It is required that you watch the lecture videos and read the lecture slides beforehand. I highly encourage you to send any of your questions/suggestions before the recitation so that I can tailor the recitation better to your needs. Attendance and participation of recitation are highly encouraged."

      "Homework": "We will have three assignments in total. Each assignment will carry the same weight. A lot of the problem solving will be performed in Jupyter notebooks using Python. You are required to submit your answer along with your Jupyter notebooks for your homework. You will be graded based on the accuracy of your answer and completeness of your steps.",
      "Quizzes": "We will have three quizzes in total. Quizzes will usually be conducted during the weekend. You can choose your time to finish the quiz, and the quiz will be timed once you start. Quiz will be posted on Canvas. All your quizzes will be graded, but only highest two will be counted towards your final grade.",
      "Final Exam": "More details of the exams will be announced later.",
      "Late Homework": "Each student has 48 hours total of leeway in late homework submission. You may choose to allocate them as you wish among the three homework assignments. Once the 48 hours are used up, no late assignments will further be accepted.",
      "Regrading Policy": "If there is any question regarding the grading of homework, please contact the instructor within seven days after receiving your grades and comments. Since I will be posting solution to the homework, you are expected to compare the solution with your own write-up before sending the request.",
      "Academic Integrity": "Group study is encouraged. However, the homework assignments MUST entirely be your own work. The derivations, estimation results, and descriptions cannot be copied from another person or from any other source. Submissions where these details are identical or nearly identical, either among peers or with another source, will be regarded as cheating. The minimum sanction for copying or other forms of cheating on a homework assignment is the loss of credit equal to two assignments, and sanctions may range up to the termination of your enrollment at CMU. All suspected incidents will be recorded with Heinz College administration at the same time the student is notified.",

      "Diversity": "We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources: * Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 2682150 * Report-It (Links to an external site.) online anonymous reporting platform: reportit.net (Links to an external site.) username: tartans password: plaid All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just."

            "Assignments": "Hands-on exercises that reinforce lecture content and occasionally introduce more challenging tasks to enhance understanding. Assignment 1 will consist of mainly short-answer questions on interpreting relational models. Most of the other assignments will typically consist of multiple query questions: writing queries to extract, present, and/or manipulate data based on requirements given. - 22.5%",
            "In-class Exams": "Checkpoints interspersed throughout the semester that assess your understanding of the materials covered up to that point. These exams help you identify areas of strength and those needing improvement, ensuring you are developing the necessary knowledge and skills to apply effectively as the course progresses. A practice exam will be provided before each exam to familiarize you with the format and types of questions you can expect. The exams are closed-book, closed-notes. - 3x22.5% = 67.5%",
            "Syllabus Quiz": "A low-stake quiz consisting of multiple-choice and multiple-answer questions with the purpose of incentivizing you to read through the course syllabus (this document) and the course schedule carefully. - 1%",

            "Regrade requests must be in writing (via email to the instructor and all TAs) and must include a copy of the original submission.",
            "Regrade requests must specify in detail the reasons you deserve a higher grade. These will typically be that (1) we added your scores incorrectly, or (2) the grader misread or misunderstood your answer or did not take something into account that they should have. For this, you should use the feedback comments as your reference point.",
            "Our top priority when grading is to maintain a consistent rubric for the same question, which means (1) all students having the same type of error will receive the same deduction, and (2) for a specific type of error, we cannot negotiate the rubric and make any exception for any individual student to deduct fewer points.",
            "Different questions focus on different parts of the course material and/or evaluate different skillsets, so their rubrics will almost certainly be different. Therefore, it is not relevant to base your regrade request of one question on the rubric applied to a different question.",
            "Referencing another student’s grade is inappropriate and irrelevant. While we do our best to apply an even standard across students, we cannot discuss anyone else’s grade with you because it is against the regulations, so we need to deal with the merits of your particular case.",
            "We reserve the right to regrade the entire assignment and thus your grade may go up or down.",

          "Description": "For other types of assessment components, including but not limited to prep works, quizzes, and exams, late submissions are not accepted unless the instructor makes a specific announcement. This policy is in place because prep works need to be done before their corresponding lectures, quizzes require immediate completion for subsequent assignments, and exams, as high-stake assessments, require consistent submission timing for fairness and uniformity. Consequently, late passes cannot be used towards these assessment components. In case you think you may miss any of these assessment components due to extenuating circumstances, it is essential that you inform us immediately so that we may find an appropriate solution to address your special needs while ensuring fairness and consistency for all students. Again, the sooner you let us know, typically the more options we can explore.",

Unless otherwise announced by the teaching team, all the work you submit should reflect individual effort. You are encouraged to discuss the high-level concepts related to the assignment questions with fellow students (with the exception of quizzes and exams), but the final work product must reflect your knowledge and effort, not your classmates’. You must acknowledge in your submission any help received on your assignments. That is, you must include a comment in your homework submission that clearly states the name of the book(s) and/or online source(s) from which you received assistance. Under circumstances announced by the teaching team that collaboration is allowed, you must also state the name of the student you collaborated with and/or the person(s) from which you received assistance.",

The recordings will be made available on Canvas typically by the end of the day on which the lecture takes place. Recordings of class sessions are covered under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and must not be shared with anyone outside your course-section. No student may record any classroom activity without express written consent from the instructor.

I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. Please note that some accommodations (such as flexibility in attendance and flexibility in assignments) cannot be implemented into the course unless you discuss it with the faculty member and develop a written agreement (consult the Office of Disability Resources for further detail). If you feel that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu."

          "Description": "We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources: Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150 Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a report by calling 844-587-0793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com. All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just."

This technology is now capable of comprehending and generating language, code, images, and videos, performing routine digital tasks, and aiding humans in advancing scientific and creative fields. These intelligent capabilities are powering novel AI user experiences such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot and other proprietary and open-source offerings. These innovations can boost human productivity and creativity, but their impact on society is unpredictable long-term. By immersing ourselves in the study of Generative AI, we not only equip ourselves for personal growth but also become architects of a future where we can help steer technology to serve humanity’s highest aspirations. This course explores the broad impacts of generative AI by considering its applications, societal implications, and how organization can govern its usage. We will explore how leveraging AI tools can help us as individuals thrive in our personal and professional lives. We will learn how both governments and private enterprises are seeking to develop beneficial and safe AI aligned with human needs. This course will provide students with practical exposure to the latest AI technologies. Students will learn the art of prompt engineering, how to use AI as a research, writing and thinking tool, and strategies to avoid common AI failure points. The first part of the course will cover how generative AI is created and applied, including the potential for it to augment human capabilities in beneficial ways. This includes a host of in-class activities using Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT and other AI tools. This will include workshops on researching and writing with the help of AI. The second part of the course will cover societal implications and governance, including public policy. Issues we will cover include: Economic and labor impact: Large generative models can be powerful tools to empower humans but could also automate many tasks that were previously done by humans, potentially leading to job loss and disruption in the job market. Information and ecosystem impact: Large generative models can be used to help moderate polarizing conversations, but they can also generate fake information (called hallucinations) and can be used to create deepfakes, poisoning the information commons. Data ownership impact: AI relies on training data in the form of text, images, and videos to learn patterns to understand and generate related output. However, open questions remain on how to compensate content owners and reward the creativity of content producers in the age of AI. Class sessions and assignments will involve hands-on AI activities, including the creation of audio and video “deepfakes” and “red teaming” of models. We will host in-class discussion groups that dissect AI public policy debates across the US, EU and international realms. Additionally, we will explore techniques for responsible AI development and release at organizations. *Note: AI tools such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot were used to help generate themes to cover in this course and to find readings, generate activities to support this curriculum, and help edit this syllabus for clarity.\",\n    \"Prerequisites\": \"There are no prerequisites for this class.

      "Course Objectives": {
        "1.-Knowledge and Content": "The driving theme of the course is to understand the nature of the U.S political system and the role that the main institutions play in determining the rights of the citizens. Is this a republic, a democracy? If a democracy, a democracy for all or for some? These questions will be answered by looking at fundamental rights such as the right to vote, the right to marry, and the right to certain basic social services among others. In the final analysis, it is in the interaction between politics and policies that these assessments will be made.",
        "2.-Structure of the course": "The first section of the course will focus on the powers of the executive and legislative branches and the issues affecting congress. The growth of presidential power and congressional polarization are the essential topics of this section. The second section will analyze the “embattled right to vote” and will provide both a historical overview of the evolution of voting rights as well as current challenges. The third section will focus on the Supreme Court’s role in defining our rights including the right to free speech, gay rights, reproductive rights, and the most essential of all: Equal Protection under the Laws, guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. The fourth section will allow us to analyze the “hidden rules of race” and their impact on economic exclusion, as well as selected policies that might have the power to repair the exclusion. Among those are health policies, welfare, social security, the wealth and employment gaps and housing. Students will be encouraged to do presentations on topics not covered in the previous sections.",
        "3.-Skills": "The course emphasizes the development of qualitative analytical skills. Students will develop these analytical skills in three different forms and through four different processes: a) Class discussions and doing a summary of the readings will allow the students to develop the ability to analyze and discuss the readings in an academic environment. b) Writing policy memos: It is critical for all of us to be able to analyze a problem and recommend policies/solutions to others. The policy memos allow the students to develop these very important skills. Students are expected to assume the role of a policy maker and provide specific policies recommendations. The policy memos emphasize the use of relevant data, the analysis of the problem, and the policy design. Detailed memo guidelines will be provided to the class with each memo prompt. c) Group presentations and paper: Group presentations are geared to allow the student to develop the ability to work on a project with two or three other students, learn about a specific topic in depth, and prepare an effective and well-structured presentation. The presentation will be followed by a group paper which needs to be structured as an analytic professional paper. Detailed instructions will be sent to each group to accomplish this goal and provide the students with a specific learning experience.",
        "4.-Conclusion": "At the end of the course the student is expected to have learned about the specific institutions and policies included in the syllabus and the principles and actors that inform those policies. Students will also develop a set of analytical, presentation, and writing skills that will be used in a professional setting."

      "Class Requirements": "Students are expected to fulfill the class requirements on the assigned dates. Make-up dates for papers will be granted only for medical reasons, or unique personal reasons. Students should present a note from the attending physician if there is a medical reason for not fulfilling the class requirements.",

        "Course Description": "This course will be on the fundamentals of Blockchain and Blockchain Technology. After covering fundamentals we will look at some applied uses and also criticisms. The best known example of Blockchain Technology in wide use today is as the storage and transaction mechanism for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. There are many other cryptocurrency networks that also use similar technology including Ethereum and Algorand. We will also use historical examples, key concepts, theory vs. practice, and examples of proposed and implemented solutions to help explain Blockchain Fundamentals. A focus for the class will be on the challenges of a given problem area and the decisions made during implementation. The history of the design and research process that ultimately led to a ‘successful’ implementation for a cryptocurrency is decades long. Bitcoin represents an elegant technical solution to a series of long posed problems which we can use to learn from. Its history as a solution builds upon many years of previous academic research some of which we will also explore during class. For even more specifics, see Narayanan, Arvind, and Jeremy Clark. 'Bitcoin's academic pedigree.' Communications of the ACM 60.12 (2017): 36-45.",
        "Textbooks": "We will use a variety of books, articles, journal papers, sources, videos, demos, and interactive materials in the course. You are not required to purchase any text to have access to all of the course reading assignments or optional materials. There is a textbook on cryptocurrency which we will read from titled Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies. You can download a free pre-publication version of the book at http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/. You are not required to own a hard copy. The book website also contains a large number of interesting Blockchain related links which you are encouraged to explore.",

On the rare occasion that an assignment is announced that it can be submitted late, the assignment will be accepted with a penalty of 10% of the total worth of the assignment per day late, up to and including the late deadline announced. Do *not* ask me to make special exceptions for you and you alone – that is NOT fair to the rest of the class. NO assignments may ever be delivered by email. Please do not ask to have a Canvas assignment re-opened online for late submission. Budget for upload time to Canvas. All assignments are due by the start time of the class which it is due (unless otherwise noted).",
            "Students with Disabilities": "Our community values diversity and seeks to promote meaningful access to educational opportunities for all students. CMU and your instructors are committed to your success and to supporting Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended and the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990). This means that in general no individual who is otherwise qualified shall be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity, solely by reason of having a disability. If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact us ASAP, and we will work together to ensure that you have the correct access to resources on campus to assist you through your coursework and time at CMU.",
            "Academic Integrity": "Collaboration is permitted in Labs but not on any other assignments. Copying code without citing it is cheating. Copying code from a fellow student is cheating. You may choose to use a large language model to assist with your programming work. If you choose to do so, add citations to your work to give credit to the LLM. Note that LLMs often make mistakes. You are responsible for any errors or problems that may be present in the code that you submit. The closed book exams are designed to test your knowledge and coding skills. So, if you do use a large language model, be sure to master the material and truly understand the code before taking an exam. However, your responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow the academic integrity guidelines of the university and of this class. If you use one of these generative AI tools to develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work, just as you should cite code acquired from any other source. If you copy code from the Web, be sure to provide a comment in the code with the exact URL where the code was copied from. In practice, cutting and pasting content from any source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing content from a generative AI without citation is plagiarism. Similarly, using any generative AI tool without appropriate acknowledgement will be treated as plagiarism. The university’s policy on plagiarism applies to all uncited or improperly cited use of work, whether that work is created by human beings alone or in collaboration with a generative AI. Provide as a comment in the code the exact URL where the code was copied from. Code that is provided by the instructors is allowed as long as the code is clearly cited as being provided by the instructors. Of course, if you have violated the spirit of the project, you will earn zero points. In addition to any penalties imposed by the instructor, all cheating and plagiarism infractions will be reported in writing to the Associate Dean for the program, the Associate Dean of Faculty, the Dean of Student Affairs, and the Dean. They will review and determine if expulsion should be recommended. The report will become part of the student’s record. The appropriate people to refer to for help in homework projects are the TAs and the instructors. They can look at your code and help you with it. See them during office hours. Carnegie Mellon University sets high standards for academic integrity. Those standards are supported and enforced by students, including those who serve as academic integrity hearing panel members and hearing officers. The presumptive sanction for a first offense is course failure, accompanied by the transcript notation “Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.” The standard sanction for a first offense by graduate students may be suspension or expulsion. Please see http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/ for any questions.",
            "Cell Phones, Smartphones and other handheld wireless devices": "Other than during class breaks, please silence ring tones and refrain from engaging in calls, messaging or other use during class time. All devices must not be visible during quizzes.",
            "Policy Regarding Students Using English as a Foreign Language": "Assignments in this course are graded with reference to evidence of the acquisition of concepts, presentation format, and accuracy of information. Having done business in countries that use languages other than English, we understand that the use of an unfamiliar language can result in unusual word choices or grammatical errors that are not critical to the overall understanding of the information. Therefore, we will take into account your need to function in a language that may be unfamiliar to you. We will provide feedback as appropriate if we feel that language or grammar you have used in assignments would be best if it were configured in a different way.",
            "Use of Canvas System for this course": "The Heinz School uses Carnegie Mellon University’s Canvas system to facilitate distance learning as well as to enhance main campus courses. In this course, we will use the Canvas system generally to post lecture notes and related documents and to receive assignments electronically from students.",
            "A Diverse, Equitable, and Inclusive Course Community": "We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources: Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150 Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: www.reportit.net username: tartans password: plaid All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.",
            "Take care of yourself": "Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help. If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night: CaPS: 412-268-2922 Re:solve Crisis Network: 888-796-8226 If the situation is life threatening, call the police: On campus: CMU Police: 412-268-2323 Off campus: 911 If you have questions about this or your coursework, please let me know."

Your application will need to scrape or otherwise obtain data from an online source, but may also include some element of static datasets. Your product will then need to clean, organize, and analyze the obtained data to produce interesting results for the user to look at (statistical results, tables, plots, ...) and perhaps interact with. Since this is a Python course, all of this will need to be in Python code: you may not download data using a browser, clean and organize the data in Excel, and then just do the analysis and display part in Python. Your entire product must be Python from beginning to end."

The essay in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the offending student’s assignments included in grade calculations; the points for that essay zero (0) will be factored into the grade. Furthermore, the cheating student’s final grade will be reduced one full letter grade. A cheating student’s final grade will be impacted significantly.

Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values."

After the 24 hours, the assignment will receive a 0% grade. Points will be deducted per this policy unless the student has made arrangements with me prior to the assignment's due date. PRIOR ARRANGEMENTS MUST BE MADE NO LATER THAN 12 PM ON THE DUE DATE. The timestamp given by Canvas will be the determining factor if the assignment is late or not. One second past the due date is still late! I suggest giving yourself enough time to log into Canvas and submit. If there are any issues, feel free to email the assignment to the instructor, in which case the email timestamp will be used. You have unlimited attempts to re-submit updated copies of your assignments in Canvas until the due date/time, and I will only consider the most recent, on-time submission for grading.",
      "Final Exam": "The final exam will consist of a network of machines that must be properly assessed to determine potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for exploitation. You will work as a group throughout the semester to compile a professional report. During the scheduled final exam time slot you will deliver an outbriefing on your findings just like on a real penetration test. Grading will be broken down as follows: Written Report – 50pts, Outbriefing – 30pts, Systems Compromised – 10pts, Peer Review – 10pts",
      "Grade Challenges": "Students will only have 2 weeks after an assignment or exam is returned to question or challenge a grade. After the two-week challenge period, the grade will not be changed. Please contact the instructor if you wish to question a grade. You must provide justification for why the specific question(s) on an assignment should be reviewed and updated.",

      "Course Description": "Agentic AI is transforming industries—from autonomous decision-making in finance to intelligent policy simulations and gaming AI. With rapid advances in LLM-powered agents, multi-agent collaboration, and AI-driven simulations, agentic technology is now one of the most dynamic areas of research and investment. This course bridges the gap between traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) and modern agentic AI, equipping participants with both foundational principles and cutting-edge techniques for building autonomous, decision-making AI systems. Designed for both AI strategists and developers, the course is offered in two modes: a no-code track for those seeking conceptual and strategic insights into AI-driven multi-agent systems, and a programming track for those wanting hands-on experience using AutoGen, LangChain, and other agent frameworks. Through interactive exercises, real-world case studies, and hands-on implementation, students will explore the evolution of emergent vs. programmed behaviors, the role of LLM-based multi-agent architectures in AI-driven decision-making, and the application of strategic policy simulations, economic modeling, and AI-driven research automation. The course blends theory and practice, ensuring students gain both a deep conceptual understanding and practical skills in designing, deploying, and evaluating autonomous AI agents. It delves into key challenges such as validation, benchmarking, and responsible AI governance, equipping participants with the frameworks necessary to assess the performance, reliability, and ethical considerations of AI-driven agents. By the end of the course, participants will be prepared to leverage agent-based modeling and AI-driven agents for solving complex real-world problems. Whether you’re a business leader, AI researcher, software engineer, or policymaker, this course provides the knowledge and tools to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of agentic AI and drive innovation in intelligent systems.",

We then will review basic macroeconomic concepts and how they relate to public policy. We will use the economic framework to explain: 1. the demand and supply components of markets; 2. when markets are efficient and equitable; 3. how government policy relates to market failure at the microeconomic level. 4. how government statistics relate to macroeconomics and subsequent policy. The focus of the class will be on public policy and its relation to economics. In order to apply economic concepts in a practical way, we will use current events as supplied by the textbook and by additional readings. I hope to help you further develop your critical thinking skills by using economic theory as a foundation for problem analysis. Examples of issues I hope to cover are: -Is free trade a good thing? -Is a minimum wage increase a good goal for society? -How can the government reduce air and water pollution? -Why does the government regulate some markets more than others? -What is the official unemployment measure and is it relevant today? -What are monetary policies to jump start a lagging economy? -What are fiscal policies to jump start a lagging economy.\",\n    \"LEARNING OBJECTIVES\": \"The course has several goals in moving you forward in your learning experience: 1. Apply basic economic concepts to everyday life. 2. Using economics, discover a problem, analyze alternative solutions to the problem, and form opinions as to which solution is best for society. 3. Improve your communication skills.\"\n  },\n  \"COURSE READINGS\": {\n    \"Required textbooks\": \"Principles of Economics by Robert Frank, Ben Bernanke, Kate Antonovics, and Ori Heffetz, 2024 Edit. You can choose whether to purchase a loose leaf copy or an e-copy. Additional handouts and readings will be provided.\",\n    \"EXPECTATIONS OF WORK LOAD\": \"You will have a lot of reading for the course and will be expected to come to class prepared. In addition, economics uses graphs and equations to make points and develop concepts. If you are unfamiliar with economics or algebra, you should plan to spend additional time working with me or with the TA. The TA will review basic graphing and algebra concepts in the first review.\"\n  },\n  \"ATTENDANCE POLICY\": \"I understand that you are adult students, usually working, and you may need to miss a class due to related obligations.

The quizzes will be on Canvas, under Quizzes. I will not time the quiz, and you will also have the ability to retake the test if you didn’t receive a score that you like. Each quiz will be worth 5 points. Quizzes will be comprised of 4-6 questions, using multiple choice or a problem or two to solve.\",\n    \"Inclass Work\": \"In class assignments often involve solving problems in a group in breakout rooms, and I will come around to help you. One person in the group should send me their answers via email to mb17@andrew.cmu.edu. If you are missing a class and an inclass assignment will be given, you can answer the questions related to that assignment prior to the start of class. Alternatively, since I drop the lowest score, you can skip an inclass assignment if you are not attending. If you are in a group breakout room, please turn on your video so that you can see one another.\",\n    \"Homeworks\": \"There will be 5 take-home assignments throughout the term. You are permitted to discuss the assignments with each other to develop approaches to solving the problems. However, you must write your own answers to the problem sets, in your own words. Do not simply copy someone else's answers. The assignments are designed to help you learn the material discussed in class and to prepare you for the tests. Therefore, if two or more homeworks look identical, those individuals will receive a 0 for that work. Or, if you happen to find the answer key online and use those answers in a homework, you will receive a 0 for that work.\",\n    \"Tests\": \"The midterm and final will be comprised of essays and problem-solving questions. The final is not comprehensive in the sense that I will ask questions that cover any topic from the semester. However, the nature of teaching economics is comprehensive: we use supply and demand curves throughout the course; the price elasticity of demand will pop up as we discuss later issues, such as monopoly power; the key assumptions and concepts of rationality and opportunity cost are used each week, at least implicitly; the key economic concepts presented by the textbook authors are concepts I hope you remember a year from now.\",\n    \"Short Report\": \"The short report will be a persuasive argument for or against an economic policy. Details will be provided later.\",\n    \"Class Contribution\": \"I expect you to come to class prepared to ask questions, discuss issues, and challenge others (including me) on their statements. I will grade this portion of the final grade as follows: 1. If someone never misses a class, but rarely speaks during discussion and never posts on Canvas, that individual will receive at most 70% of the Class contribution portion of the final grade. 2. Class discussion will be graded on the following components: - Who was prepared to answer questions from the class? - What type of discussion was developed by the individual? Were there only clarifying questions? Opinions stated? Challenges made? - How did the discussion tie in economics? - How did individuals integrate previous discussion to the issue at hand?

          "Develop a working understanding of formal object-oriented analysis and design processes.",
          "Identify and describe the primary risks inherent to large-scale software development.",
          "Apply techniques and processes designed to mitigate these risks. Construct OOAD artifacts designed to enable these processes.",
          "Develop the skills to determine which processes and OOAD techniques should be applied to a given project.",
          "Prepare students for industry by developing an understanding of the application of OOAD practices from both software project management and software development perspectives."

        "Grading": "Grading is project-based. There will be 5 projects assigned, 3 of which will be team projects. Participating in projects and project teams is mandatory, and projects all build on the same case study as the term progresses. Missing time, even early in the term, will be severely detrimental to overall project performance, and thus course grade. If a student is unable to avoid joining the class late in the semester and has missed assignment(s), the weight of these assignments on their final grade will be evenly distributed over all other assignments.",
        "Assignment Submission": "Assignments are due in digital form at the date/time shown on Canvas. Late submissions will receive a 10% grade reduction per day late.",
        "Policy on grading disputes": "When questions arise in grading of a project, the following steps must be taken to address the issue: 1. If the student(s) disagree with a deduction, they will first contact the grader and ask for an explanation of the grade. 2. If the student(s) still disagree, they will write a clear, detailed email to the professor explaining why they feel points should not have been deducted. 3. The professor will make a final decision on whether points will be returned. This procedure is mandatory to address grading issues.",
        "Lectures": "In this distance section, we will refer to recorded lectures found here: https://heinzcollege.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Channel/mediasiteadmin-95-706ooad-copyright-2016-carnegie-mellon-university/watch/c210655d0a114db4a509c514f02cf48e1d These recordings are from a section I taught on campus, and all material is valid for this distance course.

      "Summary": "Most courses under the name of 'analytics' are about making predictions (i.e., data analytics). However, predictions alone are not sufficient to solve problems. We need to produce decisions. This course focuses on the process of making good decisions. This course assumes intermediate python experience and prior exposure to management science and operations research topics. It focuses on modeling frameworks and computational tools to address complex decision-making problems that arise in policy and business. The course is organized by technical topics, from contextual optimization, optimization under uncertainty, to dynamic learning and optimization. We motivate our technical discussions by a rich set of applications, such as logistics planning, resource allocation, and health care. Coding will be done in Python. Students will use a range of modern optimization and machine learning packages.",
      "Prerequisites": [
        "An introductory course in management science/operations research",

      "Important Notes About Grading": [
        "For each assignment, it is important to include both the mathematical formulations (with clear explanation) and code, you will not receive any points if either part is missing.",
        "Collaboration on assignments is encouraged, with no more than one partner. You have to indicate whom you have collaborated with in each submission, and submit your own version of the write up and code.",
        "Project is done in teams of 3 to 5 people. Other deliverables are individual.",
        "For late submissions of most deliverables (homework, project, reading synopsis, Learning & Question survey), 5% is deducted every hour, e.g., final score of a submission is max{(s−5x),0}, where x is the number of hours late, and s is the score out of 100 if submitted on time. Quizzes are done during lecture times, and late submissions are not accepted.",
        "Final letter grades are calculated in a two-step process:",
        "We first convert percentages to letters by this mapping: A+ 97.00 – 100.00%; A 93.00 – 96.99%; A 90.00 – 92.99%; B+ 87.00 – 89.99%; B 83.00 – 86.99%; B- 80.00 – 82.99%; C+ 77.00 – 79.99%; C 73.00 – 76.99%; C- 70.00 – 72.99%.",
        "If necessary, we then curve the letter grades upward until they match Heinz College standards. There is no downward curving. This usually means a distribution similar to or better than 50% A’s and 50% B’s."
      ],
      "Special Needs": "If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources Office, please discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will be happy to discuss your specific needs privately and to work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Disability Resources Office, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.",
      "Academic Honesty": "Honesty and transparency are important features of good scholarship. The rules and the academic integrity standards outlined in your student handbook will be strictly enforced. Violations are considered a fundamental breach of trust and will result in failure of the course.",
      "Your Well-Being": "If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help. If the situation is life threatening, call the police: CMU Police 412-268-2323, or 911.",

        "Academic Coaching": "This program provides holistic, one-on-one peer support and group workshops to help undergraduate and graduate students implement habits for success. Academic Coaching assists students with time management, productive learning and study habits, organization, stress management, and other skills.",
        "Peer Tutoring": "Peer Tutoring is offered in two formats for students seeking support related to their coursework. Drop-In tutoring targets our highest demand courses through regularly scheduled open tutoring sessions during the fall and spring semesters. Tutoring by appointment consists of ongoing individualized and small group sessions. You can utilize tutoring to discuss course related content, clarify and ask questions, and work through practice problems. Visit the webpage to see courses currently being supported by Peer Tutoring.",
        "Communication Support": "Communication Support offers free one-on-one communication consulting as well as group workshops to support strong written, oral, and visual communication in texts including IMRaD and thesis-driven essays, data-driven reports, oral presentations, posters and visual design, advanced research, application materials, grant proposals, business and public policy documents, data visualization, and team projects. Appointments are available to undergraduate and graduate students from any discipline at CMU. Schedule an appointment (in-person or video), attend a workshop, or consult handouts or videos to strengthen communication skills.",
        "Language and Cross-Cultural Support": "This program supports students seeking help with language and cross-cultural skills for academic and professional success through individual and group sessions. Students can get assistance with writing academic emails, learning expectations and strategies for clear academic writing, pronunciation, grammar, fluency, and more.",
        "Supplemental Instruction (SI)": "This program offers a non-remedial approach to learning in historically difficult courses at CMU. It utilizes a peer-led group study approach to help students succeed and is facilitated by an SI leader, a CMU student who has successfully completed the course. SI offers a way to connect with other students studying the same course, a guaranteed weekly study time that reinforces learning and retention of information, as well as a place to learn and integrate study tools and exam techniques specific to a course."
      },
      "About Generative AI Tools": "In this course, you are encouraged to explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT. From time to time we may explicitly ask you to explore ChatGPT and analyze its output for certain problems. In any case, the use of GenAI tools must be appropriately acknowledged and cited, including the specific version of the tool used. Submitted work should include the exact prompt used to generate the content as well as the AI’s full response in an Appendix. Because AI generated content is not necessarily accurate or appropriate, it is each student’s responsibility to assess the validity and applicability of any generative AI output that is submitted. You may not earn full credit if inaccurate, invalid, or inappropriate information is found in your work. Deviations from these guidelines will be considered violations of CMU’s academic integrity policy. Note that expectations for 'plagiarism, cheating, and acceptable assistance' on student work may vary across your courses and instructors. Please email me if you have questions regarding what is permissible and not for a particular course or assignment.",

        "Course Description/Objective": "Data analysis is an essential component of quantitative policy analysis. However, the focused application of statistical methods extends beyond what is covered in core methods classes such as Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Program Evaluation. This course teaches students how to apply a variety of data analysis techniques using R, a free open-source statistical and graphical analysis environment increasingly used by data miners and analysts. A key focus of this course is the use of categorical variables, with a specific emphasis on documenting and quantifying disparities across demographic lines such as race, gender, and other important factors. Students will learn to apply these techniques broadly, with disparities analysis serving as a real-world example. Class sessions will combine instruction on data analysis techniques, in-class application using R, and presentations by practicing policy data analysts. Applications will focus on analysis relevant to the social safety net, including cases that emphasize consumer protection, affordable housing, homelessness, and quantifying disparities.",

      "2. COURSE DESCRIPTION": "This is a course in microeconomics and its implications for management and strategy – particularly (but not exclusively) in the context of information technology firms. Microeconomics, as discussed in this course, focuses on the models and methods by which managers can analyze their market and organizational environment to make optimal decisions. The key to such optimal decision-making is an understanding of the trade-offs in allocating scarce resources. The core models of microeconomics are fundamental to more applied areas of management such as strategy, marketing, production, and finance. The course will begin with an examination of the underlying structure and models of competitive markets, and the efficiency and welfare implications of those models. We will then examine economic models that describe firm output, pricing and entry/exit decisions. These models will then be applied to a variety of market contexts, including monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition. As we go through this analysis, we will seek to understand the implications of the theory for information technology firms and for consumers. We will also examine interesting dynamics between information, agents, and economic outcomes in the context of game theory. Most of our discussions of the economic models will be accompanied by explorations of the ideas and examples presented in the Shapiro and Varian text and in the readings."

      "Course Description": "This is an introductory course in data analysis and statistical inference. Its objective is to provide individuals who aspire to enter management or policy analysis positions with the basic statistical tools for analyzing and interpreting data. For students intending to take more advanced courses in statistics and machine learning its purpose is also to ensure that you are well grounded in the fundamentals of statistics. The course is divided into three distinct modules: descriptive statistics, statistical inference, and regression analysis. The emphasis of the lectures on descriptive statistics is the calculation and interpretation of summary statistical measures and graphical methods for describing raw data. The sessions on statistical inference are designed to provide you with the background for executing and interpreting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. The final component of the course focuses on regression analysis, a widely used statistical methodology. Throughout the course you will regularly analyze data relevant to management and policy analysis using a statistical platform developed here at CMU called ISLE.",

Sanctions for cheating include lowering your grade which may include failing the course. In egregious instances, the instructors may recommend the termination of your enrollment at CMU. Don’t cheat! It is not worth it.",
      "Use of generative AI tools": "To best support your own learning, you should complete all graded assignments in this course without the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Refrain from using AI tools to generate any content (text, video, audio, images, code, etc.) for worksheets, homework, or exams. Passing off any AI generated content as your own (e.g., cutting and pasting content into written assignments, or paraphrasing AI content) constitutes a violation of CMU’s academic integrity policy. If you have any questions about using generative AI in this course please discuss with your assigned instructor—Prof. Ben-Michael, Garin or Nagin.",
      "Late Work Policy": "You are expected to turn in all work on time. Late assignments WILL NOT be accepted.",
      "Re-grade Policy": "Any requests for a re-grade must be submitted in writing via Gradescope within seven (7) days from when the graded assignment is returned. You must include a clear written explanation of why you think your answer was not properly graded, within the comment section of Gradescope. Regrade requests without such an explanation will be automatically denied. If you are dissatisfied with the decision, you should then redirect your appeal to your assigned TA. If you are still dissatisfied you can contact your assigned instructor—Prof. Ben-Michael, Garin or Nagin. If a re-grade request is submitted, we may re-grade your entire assignment, which may either raise or lower your score. In general, we will only raise scores in cases where we have made an error in grading, and all decisions on re-grade requests are final.",
      "E-mail Questions Policy": "To balance the workload fairly among the teaching assistants, and to ensure a reasonable response time for questions received via e-mail, each student has been assigned one TA as a 'first contact'. This is the person that you should e-mail first with any questions that you might have regarding the course material, policies, etc. We will do our best to answer questions within 24 hours, or 48 hours on weekends. First contacts are assigned based on your last name.

        "Description": "Many music industry executives assert that while the top 5% of music artists can still make money selling records, the other 95% go on tour. The changes in the music industry have affected everything from how people listen to their favorite artists to the profit revenue streams for labels, promoters, and artists. This course will examine the live music touring industry on various levels, from DIY to mid-level road dogs, to arena giants. There will also be a focus on the personnel behind a successful tour including the management team, booking agents, promoters, publicists, venue owners, roadies, and technicians. We’ll discuss life on the road from the artist’s perspective and how each team member can best interact with and support the artist. Students will be able to understand the practical aspects of touring deals and the intricacies of a tour budget. Students will also work to identify and optimize touring monetization and identify best practices for promotion and merchandising, including the importance of sponsorship and branding. *Course material will reflect a pre-COVID-19 live music and touring world with discussions addressing the impact and implications of the pandemic and other recent events."

After a missed class you will be required to review the class materials as soon as possible and complete any assignments within the specified time period. Failure to take the above measures will be reflected in the class participation portion of your grade and may have an adverse effect on your grade.",
      "Audio / Video Recording": "Students may not record audio or video of classes unless instructed to do so or the instructor has given special permission. Any classroom activities recorded by a student are for the personal, educational use of that student only, and may not be further copied, distributed, published, or otherwise used for any other purpose without the express written consent of the instructor.",
      "Computer and Phone Use": "This semester involves regular use of technology during class.

        "Grading Policy": "All assignments have due dates indicated on the syllabus. In general, submitting assignments on time lets the instructional team provide feedback in a more timely and efficient manner. Assignments build on each other, so timely submissions are crucial to your progress in the class. However, sometimes life happens. If you cannot submit an assignment on time, the default will be that you will be eligible for 90% of the grade the first 48 hours after the due date/time. Assignments submitted later than that will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, no credit is guaranteed. If you need to submit beyond 48 hours past the due date/time, please contact us as soon as possible so we can make arrangements [cwelter@alumni.cmu.edu AND eberlin@andrew.cmu.edu]."

      "Units and Quality Points": "Carnegie Mellon has adopted the method of assigning a number of “units” for each course to represent the quantity of work required of students. For mini courses that run for only seven weeks, the conversion from units to the number of hours per week during the mini involves multiplying by 2. For example, a 6-unit mini course should on average involve 12 hours of student engagement. In this case the instructor requires 3 hours of in-class time, allowing the students to spend 9 hours outside of class per week. This much time will not be necessary every week, but it is a possibility for some weeks, especially leading up to the final project submission and presentation.",
      "Accommodations for Students with Disabilities": "If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will do my best to work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.",
      "Plagiarism and Cheating Notice": "In any manner of presentation, it is the responsibility of each student to produce her/his own original academic work. Collaboration or assistance on academic work to be graded is not permitted unless explicitly authorized by the course instructor(s). Students may utilize the assistance provided by the Student Academic Success Center and the Academic Resource Center (CMU-Q) unless specifically prohibited by the course instructor(s). Any other sources of collaboration or assistance must be specifically authorized by the course instructor(s)."

      "Course Description": "This course focuses on creating and delivering credible, professional, and meaningful presentations for a variety of audiences. Students will learn to connect with their audiences and increase their confidence when standing before a group or camera. These skills are important to students, job-seekers, and professionals, and while the experience of presenting isn’t everyone’s favorite (or forte), they are frequently evaluated across most career industries. In addition to honing their own techniques, students will also learn to work together to deliver a message as a group, as well as gain tips to relax and avoid common presentation pitfalls.",
      "Course Objectives": [
        "Identify and use appropriate elements for effective presentations",
        "Adapt message accordingly to connect with audiences",
        "Design and deliver logical, evidence-based, trustworthy information in an accessible format",

      "Course Materials": "There are no required books for this class, however, articles and videos may be assigned and provided throughout the course at the professor’s discretion. All rubrics for presentations will be posted in Canvas.",
      "Expectations": "This class naturally makes many students nervous. Being evaluated on the spot by professors and peers is uncomfortable for a lot of people. It’s expected that everyone will show respect to one another. Please note, there is a difference between anxiety and lack of preparedness, and it is usually obvious. It is expected that everyone will arrive prepared on days where there are student presentations, with no exceptions. Students should be patient with one another while also holding presenters to the standards outlined in all rubrics. My goal is to make this a pleasant learning experience for you. I ask that you be respectful of others by arriving to class on time and not using your electronic devices in class without discussing the purpose with me first. Please let me know if you do not understand class material or requirements or if any special circumstance prevents you from completing a class requirement on time.",

The Heinz School provides a booklet on Plagiarism and Cheating and the University lists all policies on the web at www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Cheating.html. Please acquaint yourself with their contents. Any cheating or plagiarism will result in failure in the course and your case will be referred to the Associate Dean, who may decide to take further action. Although it seems difficult to cheat in a class where you’re presenting, it’s not impossible. To avoid plagiarism, make certain you cite all sources. If you’re not sure whether or not you need to cite something, cite it. You’re not expected to come up with all new, brilliant ideas for every assignment. You can talk about what makes someone else’s ideas brilliant, though, and meet with great success. In other words, be yourself, show your brain, and acknowledge that there are other smart people in the world who have contributed to this topic.",
      "Recording academic classroom activities, lectures, etc.": "Classroom activities, lectures, etc. may not be recorded by anyone other than myself without written permission in advance.",
      "Use of electronic devices": "Few things make presenters feel worse than an inattentive audience. Even boring presenters hate to see the tops of heads rather than faces (or that tell-tale expression when you’re looking at another screen on Zoom). Please don’t disrespect each other by performing unrelated activities during class. Unless proof of necessary accommodation is provided, no student may have their laptop open in class."

      "Student Wellness": "The last few years have been challenging. We are all under a lot of stress and uncertainty at this time. I encourage you to find ways to move regularly, eat well, and reach out to your support system or me [rebekaha@andrew.cmu.edu] if you need. We can all benefit from support in times of stress, and this semester is no exception. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help. If you are worried about affording food or feeling insecure about food, there are resources on campus that can help. Email the CMU Food Pantry Coordinator to schedule an appointment: Pantry Coordinator, cmupantry@andrew.cmu.edu, 412-268-8704 (SLICE office).

If you or someone you know is interested in honing language and cross-cultural skills for academic and professional success, please visit: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/programs/language-support/index.html.",
      "Diversity Statement": "We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources: Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150 Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: reportit.net username: tartans password: plaid All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.",
      "Accommodations for Students with Disabilities": "If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu."

The purpose of the course is to explore the many dimensions of new venture development, working through issues of problem-assessment, market analysis, viability assessment, competitive positioning, team-building, product life-cycle planning, marketing and sales channel analysis, financial and business modeling and negotiation. We will explore opportunity mapping and the practical steps of building startup organizational structure associated with forming a brand-new venture. We will address strategic considerations for creating organizations that can quickly define and seize (commercial) opportunity within new categories, with principles that also apply to entrepreneurship in corporate settings and to non-profit entrepreneurship. A central component to Entrepreneurship: A New Venture is learning to synthesize and apply concepts and techniques from the Innovation Studio Process framework. Broadly, students will learn to Discover, Develop and Launch a new venture through real-world case studies and class deliberation, class lecture, guest-entrepreneur lecture and advisory, individual and team assignments, and a final business plan and presentation to a select committee.",

Preparation Plans vary depending on the case, but will broadly consider venture vision and values, opportunity mapping and segmentation, competition value proposition, go-to-market feasibility, unit economics and proforma. In review of a given case, students may be asked to consider the following: What is the problem this product and/or service is going to solve? What types of people or what types of companies suffer from this problem? How widespread is this problem? How critical is it that customer solve this problem? What is the innovation or competitive advantage behind this product? How might this venture best reach its customer base?",

      "Diversity Statement": "We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources: Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150 Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: reportit.net username: tartans password: plaid All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.",
      "Accommodations for Students with Disabilities": "If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu."

      "If we talk about something before class starts or in the hallway (an extension, a revision, another project you’d like feedback on), please plan to send me a follow-up email confirming the details."
    ],
    "COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES": [
      "Identify professional standards in various industries and international contexts and devise effective, personalized strategies for preparing and delivering your presentations",
      "Interpret the needs and expectations of audiences and adapt the content, organization, and format of your message depending on audience, context, and purpose",
      "Design, write, and present logical, cohesive messages using multimodal approaches as well as standard rhetorical organizational practices (i.e. introductions, signposts, transitions, recaps)",
      "Create presentations that conform to professional requirements such as time constraints, engaging eye contact, adequate volume, clarity in voice projection, and consistency in pace",

    "REGISTRATION": "Once a section of Strategic Presentation Skills is full, then enrollment is dependent on: (1) the number of registered students who drop the section, and (2) the waitlist order. Students who miss the first class meeting can be automatically dropped from the course. After the initial session, registration is closed. Priority registration may be given to students for whom Strategic Presentation Skills is required for graduation.",
    "OFFICE HOURS POLICIES": [
      "Office hours are designated times for students to get one-on-one feedback or ask questions; you are welcome to drop in to my physical office at any point during those times. If you would prefer to meet via Zoom during office hours, please let me know via email.",

    "ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION POLICIES": "In keeping with CMU and Heinz’s expectations and policies, including the In-Person Expectation (IPE) modality for this course, you are expected to attend all scheduled classes. The expectation from Heinz is that your attendance for this course will be in the physical classroom during all scheduled class periods. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as a commitment to accessibility presents challenges to maintaining any graded attendance policy that is equitable and based in care and safety. As your professor, I recognize and acknowledge that many of our lives may be unaffected by world events, while others will experience profound tragedies. We cannot make assumptions about others’ experiences and as a result, we ought to offer compassion, patience, and grace to one another as best we can. Therefore, there are options to help students who may need asynchronous attendance options. It is possible for you to earn all of the same points by attending class asynchronously; however, given the nature of public speaking and our active learning classroom, most students will see the most improvement by attending as many classes in person as possible.",
    "Late Arrival Policy": "Obviously, the occasional emergency can disrupt even the most organized person’s schedule; however, habitual lateness is considered unprofessional and inconsiderate. Students who arrive habitually late to class (more than five minutes late and disrupting Lightning Talks) during the semester may have their grades lowered.",

          "Description": "Our course will use this video discussion board platform to record and upload short, informal homework assignments designed to help students practice public speaking skills in a low stakes environment, asynchronous opportunities for participation/make-up discussions, as well as make ups for missed Lightning Talks. A low-stakes practice space is also available for students seeking to improve their skills beyond the requirements of the course."

    "Teaching Assistants": "Each section of this course will have a TA. Contact information and office hours will be posted on Canvas, under the “Pages” tab in the first week of the mini. The TA can answer questions, respond to issues, direct you to resources, and work through assignments with you.",
    "Syllabus Modifications": "This syllabus – especially the homework and assignment schedule – may be modified as the semester progresses in order to meet the course outcomes and best address the needs of members of the class. Pay close attention to course announcements on Canvas and in class for any of these changes.",
    "LATE ASSIGNMENTS AND MISSING WORK": {
      "DRAFTS AND PROJECT STAGES": "Drafts and project stages are a vital part of the composition process and therefore a required part of the course. Writing is a process that necessarily takes time; the project stages of this course are designed to help students focus on improving both their own personal process as well as final deliverables. As a result, all project stages must be submitted in a timely fashion; the professor reserves the right to refuse to accept a final deliverable without the accompanying required project stages.",
      "Late Assignment Penalties": "Ideally, you will avoid turning in late work. Please plan to make use of the extension policy to avoid these types of issues. In addition to the extension policy outlined above, this course has a late work policy where assignments may be turned in late for up to 24 hours with a 20% deduction. After 24 hours, students will need to schedule an office hours appointment to discuss circumstances and possible extended due dates.",
      "Extension Policy": "Each student has a single extension which they may use on any individual project or project stage. This policy excludes elements of the group presentation. If you are experiencing difficulties during the group project, contact the professor and TA immediately. To request an extension, students should: 1. Email the professor and TA no later than 24 hours prior to the deadline indicating your desire to use your extension. 2. Provide a new, reasonable date and time for the assignment to be due. If the assignment is a draft or project stage of a larger project, this date needs to come before the larger project is due. Due to the nature of the mini, for larger projects, this new date should usually be within 48 hours of the original due date. 3. This new date/time will be considered the new deadline for the assignment a. A note will be added to Canvas with this new due date for mutual reference b. The student will submit the assignment as instructed on the assignment sheet 4. The student should notify the professor and TA via email indicating the work has been submitted and is ready for grading. a. If there is any difficulty submitting the assignment to Canvas, it may also be appropriate to attach a copy to that email.",
      "Missing Work Penalties": "Due to the participatory nature of this course, it is important for work to be completed in a timely manner. In-class discussions and activities are a vital part of your success in improving your professional communication skills. I am dedicated to working with students to ensure they have equitable access to the materials and flexibility to complete the work of the course across a broad range of experiences. However, work that is missing or is significantly incomplete may not be eligible to receive points towards the course. Outside of the course policies and accommodations, students are expected to put forth a good faith effort to complete the work of the course."

    "ACADEMIC CONDUCT": {
      "Plagiarism": "Plagiarism is a serious offense that will result in the student failing the course. All academic integrity violations will be reported to the associate dean's office for the student’s program of study and the Carnegie Mellon University Division of Student Affairs. If an academic integrity violation is suspected, the student will be contacted to meet with the instructor to determine if a violation has occurred based on Carnegie Mellon University’s Policy on Academic Integrity.",
      "Note that plagiarism includes": [
        "Presenting another writer’s work (script, outline, slides, graphics, data visualizations) as your own (writer in this sense means humans and computers)",

Programming in HTML and JavaScript will combine traditional software development combined with cutting-edge Generative AI tools. AI-assisted development platforms will be overviewed to help generate code, debug errors, and experiment with advanced techniques. Web applications should leverage analytics-based insights to adapt to their users. Approaches that we will cover includes the instrumentation of a web page to capture user behavior. We will analyze data indicators as an approach to characterize users. This will allow our development to be driven by the ability to personalize the web application experience. At the same time, the course will detail how the web application is used as input to search and advertising engines which use analytics to drive users, and what to do to optimize results.

Its objective is to provide individuals who aspire to enter management or policy analysis positions with the basic statistical tools for analyzing and interpreting data. For students intending to take more advanced courses in statistics and machine learning its purpose is also to ensure that you are well grounded in the fundamentals of statistics. The course is divided into three distinct modules: descriptive statistics, statistical inference, and regression analysis. The emphasis of the lectures on descriptive statistics is the calculation and interpretation of summary statistical measures and graphical methods for describing raw data. The sessions on statistical inference are designed to provide you with the background for executing and interpreting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. The final component of the course focuses on regression analysis, a widely used statistical methodology. Throughout the course you will regularly analyze data relevant to management and policy analysis using a statistical platform developed here at CMU called ISLE.\",\n    \"Instructors\": {\n      \"Eli Ben-Michael\": {\n        \"Email\": \"ebenmichael@cmu.edu\",\n        \"Office hours\": \"10am – 11am Monday and 2pm – 3pm Tuesday.

        "Description": "Recorded music has existed for 165 years, producing remarkable artists, engineers, and technicians, but few true inventors. Les Paul stands out as a visionary who invented the modern recording studio, introducing multi-track recording, digital delay, reverb, and echo. He also created the electric pickup, leading to the first solid-body electric guitar. Without his innovations, iconic works like The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, Legendary Guitarist, Eddie Van Halen, Pro Tools, and Garage Band might not exist. Despite receiving numerous honors and awards throughout his lifetime, including being named the 18th best guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine, Les Paul is among the few artists to have a permanent exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Additionally, he is the only individual to be inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the National Inventors Hall of Fame. This course explores Les Paul’s transformative contributions and artistic achievements. Alongside his partner Mary Ford, Paul had over 33 Top 20 hits across Jazz, Pop, Country, and R&B. Despite his unmatched influence, many remember him primarily as a legacy artist. Through lectures at the MEIM, Los Angeles campus, and a hands-on session at The Les Paul Studio at United Recording in Hollywood, students will experience Les Paul's original mixing board and engage with top studio producers. This course is designed for both music enthusiasts and anyone interested in the history, innovation, and technology of modern music."

The focus of this web course will be on the development of content-based web products with a focus on front-end programming. Programming in HTML and JavaScript will combine traditional software development combined with cutting-edge Generative AI tools. AI-assisted development platforms will be overviewed to help generate code, debug errors, and experiment with advanced techniques. Web applications should leverage analytics-based insights to adapt to their users. Approaches that we will cover includes the instrumentation of a web page to capture user behavior. We will analyze data indicators as an approach to characterize users. This will allow our development to be driven by the ability to personalize the web application experience. At the same time, the course will detail how the web application is used as input to search and advertising engines which use analytics to drive users, and what to do to optimize results. To accomplish all this, AI will be used to streamline your coding process, inspire creativity, and accelerate problem-solving.",

      "Policy Regarding Students Using English as a Foreign Language": "Assignments in this course are graded with reference to evidence of the acquisition of concepts, presentation format, and accuracy of information. Having done business in countries that use languages other than English, we understand that the use of an unfamiliar language can result in unusual word choices or grammatical errors that are not critical to the overall understanding of the information. Therefore, we will take into account your need to function in a language that may be unfamiliar to you. We will provide feedback as appropriate if we feel that language or grammar you have used in assignments would be best if it were configured in a different way.",
      "Use of Canvas System for this course": "The Heinz School uses Carnegie Mellon University’s Canvas system to facilitate distance learning as well as to enhance main campus courses.

This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help. We welcome feedback during and after the course. Students are encouraged to share life experiences in class. We are open to suggestions about class sequences, changes to the content and additional topics to cover."

        "Course Description": "In all parts of the world, governments, funding agencies, organizations, and individuals are involved in activities meant to improve some aspect of people’s lives – disaster relief in Puerto Rico, human rights work in Sierra Leone, increasing school attendance in Detroit or improving outcomes for IV drug users in Barcelona are just a few examples. The needs addressed by these programs are often compelling and the programs themselves can be innovative and inspired. From those running and funding social programs to those whose needs are meant to be addressed by these programs a central question arises: Does this social program work? In this course you will learn how to gather and synthesize evidence to address this question. Program evaluation is the systematic application of social science methods to assess each aspect of a program: the need for the program, the program's design and implementation, and ultimately the program’s impact on relevant outcomes. A completed program evaluation results in (a) information regarding the program’s merit, (b) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (c) the implications of both (a) and (b) for decision making. Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry out evaluation internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or only on outcomes. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading. This course is designed to familiarize the student with the central concepts and methods of program evaluation. Students will be taught how to conduct basic program evaluations as well as how to contribute to, critique, and monitor more comprehensive program evaluations. Successful completion of this course will prepare students to be productive members of teams that design and carry out program evaluations or that commission program evaluations and make decisions based upon their results.",
        "Learning Objectives": [
          "Be a valuable member of an evaluation team, able to contribute to both planning and execution, while having a solid foundation on which to build.",

        "Final Remark": [
          "Use of electronic devices during class: As research on learning shows, unexpected noises and movement automatically divert and capture people's attention, which means you are affecting everyone’s learning experience if your cell phone, pager, laptop, tablet, etc. makes noise or is visually distracting during class. For this reason, I ask you to turn off your mobile devices, and use your laptop/tablet only to take notes and/or to access assigned materials."

        "Statement Regarding Diversity and Inclusion": "We must treat every individual with respect. We at Heinz College are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, and I as your professor, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.",
        "Statement of Support for Students’ Health & Well-being": "Your graduate school experience might prove to be exciting, stimulating, and enjoyable, but it is likely to entail stress as well. The University Provost provides the following thoughts for students. I consider them important. Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available through CMU and an important part of the graduate school experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.",

Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or assignment or as cheating on an examination, regardless of whether it is a take-home or in-class examination. The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the program. There are many other ways in which a violation can occur.\",\n        \"Academic Dishonesty: Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards inside and outside the classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e. plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration) is obviously discouraged and will be treated appropriately.

Academic integrity is essential for all students and it is the responsibility of all faculty members to provide learning environments that foster and enforce academic integrity.

The content generated from these sources are not substitutes for your own research, generative thinking, analysis, expression, synthesis or reasoned arguments. You must follow the academic integrity guidelines of the university and of this class. If you use one of these generative AI tools to develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work. Treat information from these tools as if they are like the sharing of an algorithm’s output (because that is what it is). Any such use must be appropriately acknowledged and cited, following the guidelines established by the APA Style Guide (or equivalent in MLA or Chicago styles), including the specific version of the tool used. Submitted work should include the exact prompt used to generate the content as well as the AI’s full response in an Appendix. Following the APA Style Guide, the proper handling of the citation is to give credit to the author of the algorithm. Include this information as an entry in a reference list. Provide a corresponding in-text citation. The results should be acknowledged as a source and checked for validity and credibility with your own additional research. Cutting and pasting content from any source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing content from a generative AI without citation is plagiarism. Similarly, using any generative AI tool without appropriate acknowledgement will be treated as plagiarism. The university’s policy on plagiarism applies to all uncited or improperly cited use of work, whether that work is created by human beings alone or in collaboration with a generative AI.\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"Course Policies & Expectations\": {\n      \"Professionalism\": \"Your entire experience is geared toward helping you develop skills necessary to participate in the world as a qualified professional. This means taking responsibility for the work that you produce and for your conduct among your student colleagues and other members of the university community. Quality work in developing knowledge, skills, and wisdom are the most important goals to keep in mind. Quantity of product and number of hours spent working are secondary to overall quality.\",\n      \"Attendance\": \"Students are expected to attend all sessions. Students may be excused from two classes for professional, health, or personal reasons when the instructor is notified of the pending absence. Attendance performance is used as a multiplying factor in the final grade.\",\n      \"Participation\": \"It is essential for all students to participate fully in class in their case evaluation teams.

Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice.

      "Academic Integrity": "Carnegie Mellon University sets high standards for academic integrity. Those standards are supported and enforced by students, including those who serve as academic integrity hearing panel members and hearing officers. The presumptive sanction for a first offense is course failure, accompanied by the transcript notation “Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.” The standard sanction for a first offense by graduate students may be suspension or expulsion. Please see http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/ for any questions.",
      "Cell Phones, Smartphones and other handheld wireless devices": "Other than during class breaks, please silence ring tones and refrain from engaging in calls, messaging or other use during class time. All devices must not be visible during quizzes.",
      "Policy Regarding Students Using English as a Foreign Language": "Assignments in this course are graded with reference to evidence of the acquisition of concepts, presentation format, and accuracy of information. Having done business in countries that use languages other than English, we understand that the use of an unfamiliar language can result in unusual word choices or grammatical errors that are not critical to the overall understanding of the information. Therefore, we will take into account your need to function in a language that may be unfamiliar to you. We will provide feedback as appropriate if we feel that language or grammar you have used in assignments would be best if it were configured in a different way.",
      "Use of Canvas System for this course": "The Heinz School uses Carnegie Mellon University’s Canvas system to facilitate distance learning as well as to enhance main campus courses. In this course, we will use the Canvas system generally to post lecture notes and related documents and to receive assignments electronically from students.",
      "Take care of yourself": "Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.

In this course, students will gain a practical understanding of museum operations and the unique and multi-factored challenges of modern museum management. The course emphasizes museum standards and best practices, particularly within American art museums, as well as identifies resources both within and adjacent to the industry. Cross-cutting topics which will build upon MAM first year coursework include governance, financial sustainability, facilities, administration, visitor engagement and education, and collection stewardship. Additionally, case studies (via assignments and class discussion) address complexities in the museum field today such as diversity, equity, and inclusion in museum settings; issues in collections management, ethics, and deaccession debates; toxic philanthropy, and risk management."

After the first absence, the student’s overall letter grade for the course is subject to reduction by half a grade. If there are extenuating circumstances that require a student to miss more than one class session, please make arrangements to discuss the matter in advance; I would like to find a way to support you. For students who attend all classes; 5 extra points will be added to your lowest homework score when computing your final grade (i.e., extra credit). This will be the only option for extra credit within the course. Because we will devote some class time to discussion around assignments, it is important to note that our participation together will be less concerned with finding an “answer” during the discussion; but instead working together to engage in thoughtful conversation.",
      "Missed Classes": "Students are responsible for any material they miss in class. Please review Canvas and discuss with a classmate who can inform you of any missed material, or please contact the instructor in advance of any foreseeable absences (as outlined in the attendance policy), so that you may continue your course work.",
      "Late / Make Up Work": "Due dates for every assignment are provided on the course syllabus and in Canvas. Unless otherwise stated, assignments are due on those days. However, recognizing that sometimes life presents unknowns, you will be allotted one assignment that can be turned in late – up to two days – without penalty. That excludes the group assignment which must be turned in on time; if that is turned in late then 5 points will be deducted from your group score, per day that it is late. For any assignment that is turned in late beyond the one time allowance without penalty, 5 points will be deducted from your score on that assignment."

Misrepresentation of another’s work as your own (e.g. plagiarism and cheating) is widely recognized as a very serious matter. Cases of cheating and plagiarism are viewed by the University as extremely serious. Students found to have cheated or plagiarized on an assignment will receive a zero on the assignment and information about the offense will be submitted to the Dean’s office for review. Severe penalties may be imposed, up to and including expulsion.",
      "Recordings": "Students are allowed to record class sessions only with the instructor’s permission. Permitted recordings are only for your personal use. Distribution of any recording is prohibited. This is to protect your FERPA rights and those of your fellow colleagues.",

Inthiscourse, studentswillhaveabasicunderstandingofhowtosolveproblemsusingdataanalyticstechniquesinTableau. This course will cover the basics of how to use Tableau to visualize and analyze data effectively and create compelling dashboards and data stories. This course will not go into mathematical details behind analytics techniques but rather their applications and how to leverage insights for decision-makers from them. This course will face students with real examples and real-world data, as an increasing number of organizations nowadays collect data to support their decision-making process. The format for this course will be a combination of weekly lectures, interactive in-class activities, and case studyteamsessions. Thecoursewillalsohaveateamprojectwherestudentswillapplytheconceptslearned in a topic of their interest.

          "Attendance": "Everyoneisexpectedtoattend–andparticipatein–lectures. Studentsmaymisstwolectures with no penalty. If you anticipate more absences, please speak with me as early as possible. During the lectures, I will introduce the concept, and then you will work with the data to apply the concepts learned. If you miss a class the day we work on a case study, please make sure you communicate with me in advance to make prearranged plans to submit the assignment on time and prevent points from being deducted. This course will actively engage in generating data stories. The course content is designed to be applicable to other courses, and I hope you find it resourceful, insightful, and fun. To ensure effective learning, I encourage you to prepare with the recommended materials and readings, and revise past materials. Keep in mind that there are different ways of achieving the same goal and multiple stories to be told from the same dataset. Your first job is to understand the data, its context and analyze it with an open mind. We will work together to help you enhance your data literacy, enhance your analytical skills, and wrap them into compelling dashboards and data stories. This is an iterative process where you will make mistakes - as we all do - and learn from your peers, your instructor, your TAs, and your own mistakes.",
          "Classroom behavior": "Please arrive on time. If you arrive after the class has started, please enter quietly to avoid distracting other students and interrupting the lecture. Laptops, and ipads are permitted in class for taking notes or for class activities. Please refrain from using cellphones or electronics for other purposes during class. This might distract other students and keep you from fully engaging with the class activities.",
          "Participation": "The class is going to be a combination of lectures and in-class activities. Participation is highly encouraged to keep the class interactive. All questions are good questions. You are all here to learn and your question might help other students. We are all responsible for creating a safe and collaborative learning environment. For doing so, I expect you to respect each other ideas and learning process. Thisisaninterdisciplinaryclass,andallofyouhavedifferentexperiencesandknowledgetobringtotheclass.",
          "Communication": "If you need to communicate with me, please come to my office hours or send me an email. If you have time conflicts with my office hours, email me and we can arrange another time to meet. I am committed to replying to your emails within 24 hours on weekdays. For emails sent after 5:00 pm on Fridays, please allow until Monday morning. In this course we will use Piazza as the main source of communication. Piazza should be used for general course-related questions that may interest others in the class. The quicker you begin asking questions, the quicker you’ll benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. We encourage you to ask questions when you’re struggling to understand a concept. The course also has between 3-5 hours of office hours each week. We will adjust the number of office hours depending on student participation in this space. We strongly encourage you to attend office hours! If you are unable to attend office hours please send me an email and we can find an alternative time to meet."

        "Assessment": {
          "Project": "You will work on a group project throughout the course. The main objective of the project is to create a cohesive analysis in the form of a dashboard or data story from a given dataset. This assignment is significant and time-consuming, as it tests various aspects of the course. To ensure that all teams receive feedback throughout the mini, the project will have weekly assignments, including a final report and a final presentation. The final presentation and report will happen at the end of the semester on Week 7 (02/27). There will be special guests on the final presentations. Specific details of the project and the weekly deliverables can be found on the Course Project Canvas page. In order to give you helpful and prompt feedback from Prof. Barrios and the TAs, no late assignment are allowed for the projects. For the project, teams will be assigned by the professor to guarantee that a mix of disciplines is represented ineachteam. Teamsconsistoftwoorthreestudents. Allstudentslistedonateamsubmissionareexpected to contribute meaningfully to the assignment. If you have not contributed to the team, you are expected to submit an individual presentation and report.",
          "In-class activities - case studies": "To gain hands-on learning experience, we will work on in-class case studies. Some of these case studies will have an individual deliverable, and some will have a group deliverable. These assignments are designed to help students practice and apply class content through small challenges. Students will work with others in randomly assigned groups to complete the case study, which will be evaluated based on effort, not accuracy. Groups will have the opportunity to attempt and discuss these challenges and later share their findings with the rest of the class. This will allow everyone to learn from each other’s diverse experiences and backgrounds. Students will be able to access a solutions after the case studies have been submitted. Class activities are meant to be finished in class; by the end of class you should submit your work regardless of how much is completed.",
          "In-class activities - follow along": "During lecture time, students will be expected to follow along with the Tableau exercise demonstrated in class. While follow-along are meant to be finished during class time, students will have until the next day to submit their work. That is, if the follow-along is on a Tuesday, you have until Wednesday at midnight to submit your work, if the follow-along is on a Thursday, you have until Friday at midnight to submit your work. This allows students to have more time to complete the Tableau follow-along, accountingforthefactthattheymightsometimesexperiencetechnicaldifficultiesduringclass, fall behind in the demonstration, or need more time to refine their work. These hands-on exercises are a great way to build up the practical experience you’ll then require for your case study challenge and final projects.",
          "Class participation": "Participation will be graded based on attendance, participation in class activities, and preparation for class (readings or additional assignments before class). To make the class interactive, I expect all of you to come prepared to class, engage in class discussions, and share your results from class activities. Your grade will be based on in-class engagement, both during lectures and contributing to team activities. The lack of attendance, and the use of mobile devices, including phones and laptops, will count against your participation grade."
        },
        "Regrade policy": "We are committed to returning work to you as quickly as possible. Our goal is to grade assignments and return them within one week of the due date. Graded assignments will be available for review on Gradescope. All appeals for grading must be made within 2 weeks of the due date of the assignments. Please clearly explain why you believe your assignment was not graded correctly. Please use Gradescope to submit your re-grading request.",

This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources: Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150 Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a report by calling 844-5870793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com.

We will consider the power of media to persuade, the extent to which media outlets are ideologically slanted, the role of new information technologies, and associated policy challenges. We will further consider how the media's stewardship of American democracy evolved over time. The media is ever-changing, and as such, this course is designed to raise questions that may not have clear or easy answers. However, students should leave this course equipped with the knowledge and tools to develop their own understanding of the complex relationship between the media and politics."

That said, I am cognizant of various barriers that would make a formal assignment requiring participation unfair. To encourage such participation, I’m offering up to 3 percent extra credit not to exceed a final course grade of more than 100% for any student that: (1) Participates in volunteer work or interacts with a non-profit, government agency, grassroots organization at some point after the start of this class. These activities include but are not limited to going to a local government town hall, volunteering as a poll worker, attending a campaign event, watching a congressional hearing online, or even watching past campaign rallies on YouTube. Please note that you do not need to participate in a partisan or government-sponsored event to complete this activity as long as you can link the activity to the media and politics and is completed after the start of our class. If an online option is chosen, the engagement must be equivalent to the time it would take to attend a meeting in person (at least 1 hour in length). (2) Writes a 500-word, single-spaced reflection on your experience, tying what you learned to a concept studied in our class. Details for this assignment will be on Canvas, including formatting expectations. This paper must be completed and submitted by 11:59 pm March 1st."

However, I recognize that sometimes “life happens.” In these instances, you are allotted one flex day for use during the semester. These days allow you to submit one assignment one day late without penalty. You can use this day for any reason. You do not need to provide me with the explanation: simply email me and tell me you would like to use your flex day and include this information at the top of your submitted assignment. Flex dates cannot be used for group assignments or presentations. Once you’ve exhausted your flex day, point deductions will occur for any assignment submitted after the deadline. A late assignment submitted within 24 hours of the due date will only be eligible for 80% of the maximum number of points allotted. From 24-48 hours after the deadline, assignments will be eligible for 60% of the maximum number of points allotted. Assignments submitted more than 48 hours after the due date will not be accepted. If you experience extenuating circumstances (e.g., you are hospitalized) that prohibit you from submitting your assignments on time, please let me know. I will evaluate these instances on a case-by-case basis and will require documentation.",
        "Attendance and participation policy": "Attendance for this course is mandatory. Course Discussions are designed to ensure that you learn not just from your instructor but also from your peers. Each student who stays home from class or does not contribute is a lost perspective and a counterpoint that could have been raised. Please come to class prepared, having read, viewed, or listened to the assigned materials. Quality comments in a course discussion include at least one of the following characteristics: Builds on another comment, Contributes toward moving the discussion or analysis forward, Offers a different and unique perspective that is relevant to the discussion, Demonstrates reflective thinking that includes some evidence, argumentation, or recognition of inherent tradeoffs. Students who do not attend class will have their final grades reduced as follows: 2 unexcused absences: One-point reduction in grade (i.e., from A to B), 3-4 unexcused absences: Two-point reduction in grade (i.e., from A to C), 5+ unexcused absences: Students will fail the course. That said, please do not come to class sick. If you are ill or have been exposed to COVID-19 and are worried about attending class, I ask that you first email me. If you feel well enough to participate in class, I will make every effort to include you in class via a virtual method, like Zoom. If you cannot attend a class session due to sickness or a school-sanctioned event, please email me at least 2 hours before the missed class to ensure it is an excused absence.",
        "News Consumption": "Thinking about the relationship between the news media and politics requires maintaining familiarity with the news, how it’s covered, and the organizations and personalities behind the production of news. I HIGHLY recommend all students regularly read the political news coverage from one of the major national newspapers (in print or online): The New York Times, The Washington Post, or The Wall Street Journal. In addition, please choose another supplementary news source to read or watch at least weekly, such as Breitbart, National Review, Politico, Slate, Talking Points Memo, the Weekly Standard, ThinkProgress, or any cable news programming (for example, CNN, Fox News, or MSNBC). Please also watch for different political news content you encounter on your social media accounts.",
        "Re-grade policy": "I will strive to assign grades that fairly and accurately reflect the quality of the work you submit. Any requests for re-grades must be submitted to me in writing within one week of receiving your graded work back, and you must explain in writing why you feel your grade was inappropriate. Regrades can result in raising or lowering your initial grade. I will only regrade assignments in cases where a grade change may alter your final grade in the course.",
        "Recording Classes": "No student may record classroom activity without my written consent. We discuss sensitive topics in class, and each student should feel comfortable contributing. That said, if you have (or think you may have) a disability such that you need to record or tape classroom activities, please contact the Office of Disability Resources to request an appropriate accommodation.",
        "Academic Integrity & Collaboration": "Honesty and transparency are important features of good scholarship. Conversely, plagiarism and cheating are serious academic offenses with serious consequences. If you are discovered engaging in either behavior in this course, you will earn a failing grade on the assignment in question, and further disciplinary action will be taken. For a clear description of what counts as plagiarism, cheating, and/or the use of unauthorized sources and tools, please see the University’s Policy on Academic Integrity (revised in April 2013): https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academicintegrity.html I encourage you to use campus resources like the Student Academic Success Center (SASC) to assist you in your pursuit of academic excellence. However, please note that in accordance with the university’s policy, you must acknowledge any collaboration or assistance that you receive on work that is to be graded, either from a person, reference, or a tool (including tools like Grammarly). So, when you turn in any assignments, please include a sentence at the end that says either: “I worked alone on this assignment.”, or “I worked with __________ [person or tool] on this assignment.” and/or “I received assistance from _________ [person or tool] on this assignment.” Note that providing this information will not impact your grade and will only serve to help me understand you better. If you have questions about my integration of the university’s policy into this course, please do not hesitate to ask. I aim to foster an environment where you can learn and grow while ensuring that the work we all do is honest and fair.

        "Use of Artificial Intelligence/Chat GPT": "Assignments in this course are designed to improve your communication skills and ability to apply class concepts in your arguments. I also hope written assignments from this class can be used as writing samples for job applications. To best support your learning and future career development, you may not use generative AI tools to build the arguments in your paper or write any component of your project, including brainstorming topics. These activities are essential for developing the fundamental skills and expertise represented by the learning objectives of this course. Generative AI tools rely on probabilistic models to generate content, which may sometimes be incomplete, inaccurate, unoriginal, or biased. I have even seen AI plagiarizing content without a student’s knowledge. An AI tool should not be considered a substitute for traditional approaches to research. You are ultimately responsible for the content of the information you submit and may not attempt to pass off work generated by an AI program as your own. All written submissions must be submitted with changes tracked. Passing off any AI-generated content as your own (e.g., cutting and pasting content into written assignments, paraphrasing AI content, or using AI to brainstorm your paper topic) constitutes a violation of CMU’s academic integrity policy. However, there is one major exception. Generative AI is a powerful tool for gaining feedback on the quality of your paper and identifying strengths and weaknesses before submitting final drafts. In this spirit, you may use generative AI tools to obtain feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of your paper. This feedback can help you identify areas for improvement in your writing. As an important line, this process will be considered academic dishonesty if generative AI changes your paper’s text or re-writes/constructs your thesis, argument, or examples . You must implement any recommendations made on your own. An example of an appropriate prompt is provided here.3 If you choose to use generative AI in this spirit, you must cite the generative AI platform used and submit a log of prompts you use when interacting with generative AI. If you have any questions about using generative AI in this course, please email or talk to me."

        "Description and Breakdown of Readings": "All readings are required. All are linked in this document and/or provided through the course Canvas site in Modules. Comment on Readings: I believe in incorporating a wide array of people and perspectives in this class. This commitment means making sure that we cover the work of scholars from diverse backgrounds. This integration of diverse perspectives is often less explicit as we use examples from a variety of people and places to illustrate arguments and motivate thought. I’ve worked on this balance through discussions with colleagues. I won’t be perfect, but I will continue to work on making this class a place where everyone can find something new to become fascinated and challenged by the media and public policy. Please come talk to me with positive and negative feedback as well as readings of interest. My office door, email inbox, and ears are always open."
