Course Description
Modern information security is full of big data problems. Discovering patterns and trends in cybersecurity incident
data, detecting anomalous network or host traffic, predicting the likelihood of an email message containing
malicious attachments or links – these are all examples of combining data sources and analytic techniques to
preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems. In this course, we
will cover analytic techniques such as clustering, classification, and anomaly detection, in the context of their
applicability to the information security domain. We will explore the data sources that can be mined for security
information. We will use hands-on labs to provide practical experience applying analytic techniques to these data
sources. Finally, we will present strategies that can be used ensure the outputs of information security analytics are
accurate, understandable, and actionable by security practitioners and business decision makers alike.

### Labs / Assignments / Final Project

There will be in-class labs for weeks 2-6 of this class. There will be 2 assignments based on topics covered in
lectures, additional assigned readings, and your work in the lab sessions. In addition, there will be a final project in
which students will select a topic germane to security data analytics for independent research, submit a research
project proposal for approval, and develop a 5-8-page report on their chosen topic. Following is a list of due dates
for each assignment:
Item Due Date

Homework: 30%
Final Project: 40%
Grading Scale
100 – 98 A+ 81 – 80 B97 – 92 A 79 – 78 C+
### 91 – 90 A- 77 – 72 C

89 – 88 B+ 71 – 70 C87 – 82 B Below 70 R
Grade Distribution
I plan on using the Heinz School guidelines in deciding on the overall grade distribution. Accordingly, the average
grade will be an A-. However, I grade on an absolute scale. If every student does well in the class, each will get an
A+ regardless of the recommended grading scale. The same holds true on the other end of the scale. Students will
only have 2 weeks after an assignment or exam is returned to question or challenge a grade. After the two-week
challenge period, the grade will not be changed. Please contact the instructor if you wish to question a grade.

Late assignment policy
All assignments are due at 11:59 PM EST on the assigned due date. I WILL NOT accept late homework unless the
student has made arrangements with me prior to the assignment's due date. PRIOR ARRANGEMENTS MUST BE
MADE NO LATER THAN 12 PM ON THE DUE DATE.

Policy on cheating and plagiarism
This course follows Heinz School and Carnegie Mellon policies for student conduct, including policies that address
inappropriate student collaboration and plagiarism. Each student is responsible for handing in their own work. For
any assignment found to be the partial or complete result of cheating or plagiarism, your grade for that assignment
will be zero. Cheating is defined as inappropriate collaboration among students on an assignment. This can include
copying someone else’s work with or without alteration. When students are found to be collaborating in this way,
BOTH will pay the penalty regardless of who originated the work.

Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to
discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure
that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit
from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact
them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Student Wellness
Take care of yourself, and each other! Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well,
exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help you
achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone.

There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning
how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know
experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage
you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their
website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust
for help getting connected to the support that can help.
### How to Succeed in This Class

## 1. Get started on the final project as soon as possible. Even just spending some time in week 1 thinking about

topics you may be interested in learning more about can make a significant difference.
## 2. Do not get stuck on syntax when working on labs and homework assignments. If you find yourself spending

large amounts of time troubleshooting syntax errors for a query, reach out to me.
## 3. Complete the assigned readings for each week, if not before the class for which they are assigned, then after

that class and before the next.
## 4. Use office hours productively. Get feedback on your final project, suggestions for references, tips on homework

or lab questions, and clarifications of lecture materials. Make sure you are comfortable applying the concepts
and lessons learned from course case studies to new requirements or use cases.
