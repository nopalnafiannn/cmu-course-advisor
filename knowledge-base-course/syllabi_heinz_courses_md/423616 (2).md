### Time Series Forecasting in Python

Introduction
Time Series Forecasting is something of a dark horse in the field of data science. It is
one of the most applied data science techniques in business - used extensively in
finance, in supply chain management, and in production and inventory planning.

Moreover, it has a well established theoretical grounding in statistics and dynamic
systems theory. Yet, it retains something of an outsider status in data science
compared to more recent and popular machine learning methods such as image
recognition and natural language processing. Consequently, Time Series Forecasting
gets little or no treatment at all in introductory data science and machine learning
courses.

This course is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to forecasting
methods without deep diving into the theoretical details behind each method.

Although, the references at the end of each week will fill in many of those details.

The course is intended for the following three audiences.
## 1. Graduate or PhD students studying in STEM or business fields.

## 2. People doing forecasting in business who may not have had any formal

training in the area.
## 3. MBA students doing a data elective.

## 4. Also relevant for those studying public policy, healthcare management, and

related disciplines.

CourseRelevance
● Time Series Forecasting is one of the most applied data science techniques in
business - used extensively in finance, in supply chain management, and in
production and inventory planning.
● If you are a data professional, there are very high chances that you will have to
analyze time series data in your career.
● Used across all sectors and industries.

Prerequisites
● It is assumed that course participants are familiar with

*  Introductory statistics.
*  High-school algebra.
### *  Graphical methods for describing quantitative data - line plots,

histograms, barplots, box plots, correlation plots.
*  Numerical measures of Central Tendency.
*  Numerical measures of Variability.
*  Using the Mean and Standard Deviation to describe data.
*  Joining data - inner, outer, right, and left join.
*  Hypothesis testing.
### *  Simple linear and multiple regression - model assumptions, fitting the

model, assessing utility of model.
*  Splitting data into test-train splits and cross validation.
*  Model performance evaluation metrics - RMSE, MAE, MAPE.
● Basic Python knowledge required - ability to read data and ability to perform
basic manipulations using pandas and numpy libraries.
● If you don’t have prior experience with the aforementioned, you can still
enroll if you have the willingness to learn.
● Bring your enthusiasm and curiosity.

Technology Stack
We will use Python as a tool to analyze time series data and generate forecasts. The
intention is for students to learn how to manipulate and wrangle data with Python.

Python is free and available on almost every operating system. It is a wonderful tool for
all statistical analyses, not just for forecasting. Also, it is one of the most widely used
programming languages in business. Please have Jupyter Notebook installed on your
device as we will be using it for data analysis.

Learning Objective
● Forecaster’s Toolbox - Build and apply time series forecasting models in a
variety of business contexts using tools that are useful for many different
forecasting situations such as the following.
● Benchmark/Simple forecasting methods.
● Ways of making the forecasting task simpler using transformations and
adjustments.
● Residual analysis - methods for checking whether a forecasting method has
adequately utilized the available information.
● Techniques for computing prediction intervals.

● Be able to use a range of forecasting methods - ETS (Error, Trend,
Seasonality), Holt Winter’s, ARIMA (Autoregressive, Integrated, Moving
Average), SARIMA, VAR (Vector Autoregression), and a suite of machine
learning models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector
Regression, etc.
● Be able to use graphical methods to explore the time series data,
analyze the validity of the models fitted, and present the forecasting results.
● Develop skills, mindsets, and behaviors that are most sought after in the
industry today - data science, product management, entrepreneurship, and
storytelling.
● Don’t think like a Data Scientist / Software Engineer / Solutions Architect /
Tech Consultant. Think like a CEO. Take an end-to-end view.
### Learning Process and Course Format

● This course is mostly 100% Virtual and runs synchronous. I live in San
Francisco and sometimes travel to campus in Pittsburgh, PA. There is an
opportunity to meet face-to-face at such times.
● All lectures are scheduled via Zoom on Wednesdays, 6.30-9.20 pm EST. The
links will be provided on Canvas. Go to the zoom tab on the left-hand side.

All lectures will be recorded. I’ll be sharing the recordings after class via
email. Please make sure that your Internet connection and equipment are
set up to use Zoom. Let me know if there is a gap in your technology set-up
as soon as possible, and we will work together to find a solution.
● Attendance Policy - mandatory - 5% of the grades are towards attendance
and engagement in class. If you are consistently unable to attend the live
zoom sessions due to any reason, you may stay registered and watch the
lecture recordings afterwards but will lose the 5% participation points for not
attending live.
● For the purpose of building a classroom community to drive better
learning outcomes, it is mandatory to turn on your cameras during
class. Having a virtual background is completely fine. We are already
physically distanced. Let’s not be physically invisible too. If you cannot share
your video for some valid reason, please let me know beforehand. Some or
all class engagement points will be deducted for not turning on your cameras
without giving me a heads up on a consistent basis.
● Assignments - This course has one quiz and two assignments that you
need to complete individually. We do not have a final exam but we have a

final group project that you need to complete working in groups with your
peers. I’ll be sharing more details in class. All expectations and submission
deadlines will be shared in class.
● Class presentations, datasets that we will be exploring, supervised readings,
and any other content to supplement the learnings will be shared in class
and via emails.
● How to reach out to me? This course does not have a TA. If you have any
questions about the coursework, submissions, or any other questions in
general, please feel free to email me (tshaikh@alumni.cmu.edu) or message
me on Canvas and I will get back to you as soon as I can. Generally, I get
back within 2-3 hours.
