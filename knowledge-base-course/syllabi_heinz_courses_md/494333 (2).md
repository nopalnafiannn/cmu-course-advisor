Course Description
Theriseindataavailabilityandanalyticaltoolshastransformedthedecision-makingprocess. Inthiscourse,
studentswillhaveabasicunderstandingofhowtosolveproblemsusingdataanalyticstechniquesinTableau.

This course will cover the basics of how to use Tableau to visualize and analyze data effectively and create
compelling dashboards and data stories. This course will not go into mathematical details behind analytics
techniques but rather their applications and how to leverage insights for decision-makers from them. This
course will face students with real examples and real-world data, as an increasing number of organizations
nowadays collect data to support their decision-making process.

The format for this course will be a combination of weekly lectures, interactive in-class activities, and case
studyteamsessions. Thecoursewillalsohaveateamprojectwherestudentswillapplytheconceptslearned
in a topic of their interest.

At the end of the course, you will be able to use Tableau to effectively communicate stories with data.

It is recommended that students have taken a statistics course such as 90-707, 90-711, or 95-786.

Course Objectives
### At the end of this course, you should be able to:

### *  Scope a project based on data and clearly describe the objective

### *  Use descriptive analytic tools to give insights into the current situation of the system

### *  Apply and comprehend commonly used data analytics techniques with Tableau Desktop

*  Understand multiple data analytics techniques’ advantages, disadvantages, and utility.
### *  Produce effective data visualizations that allow for data exploration and storytelling

### *  Develop analytics that yield insights for different stakeholders through Tableau sheets, data stories,

and dashboards.
### *  Communicate your visualizations to different stakeholders in the decision process

Course Resources
Lectures and materials will be posted weekly on Canvas. I will not follow a single textbook. The following
references can be helpful as supplemental materials:
*  Ryan Sleeper, Practical Tableau: 100 tips, tutorials, and strategies from a Tableau zen master. Ben
Jones, Communicating Data with Tableau
### *  Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, Storytelling with Data

All the books above are available online through CMU’s Library or O’Reilly (you all have free access to all
their books with your CMU email).Keep an eye on Canvas for assigned readings and materials. The Canvas
page called “Resources” will be updated throughout the semester.

YouwillalsohaveaccesstostudentlicensesofTableauforthedurationofthesemester. Alltheinformation
can be found on the “Resources” Canvas page.

Class expectations
Attendance: Everyoneisexpectedtoattend–andparticipatein–lectures. Studentsmaymisstwolectures
with no penalty. If you anticipate more absences, please speak with me as early as possible. During the
lectures, I will introduce the concept, and then you will work with the data to apply the concepts learned.

If you miss a class the day we work on a case study, please make sure you communicate with me in advance
to make prearranged plans to submit the assignment on time and prevent points from being deducted.

This course will actively engage in generating data stories. The course content is designed to be applicable
to other courses, and I hope you find it resourceful, insightful, and fun. To ensure effective learning, I
encourage you to prepare with the recommended materials and readings, and revise past materials. Keep in
mind that there are different ways of achieving the same goal and multiple stories to be told from the same
dataset. Your first job is to understand the data, its context and analyze it with an open mind. We will
work together to help you enhance your data literacy, enhance your analytical skills, and wrap them into
compelling dashboards and data stories. This is an iterative process where you will make mistakes - as we
all do - and learn from your peers, your instructor, your TAs, and your own mistakes.

Classroom behavior: Please arrive on time. If you arrive after the class has started, please enter quietly
to avoid distracting other students and interrupting the lecture. Laptops, and ipads are permitted in class
for taking notes or for class activities. Please refrain from using cellphones or electronics for other purposes
during class. This might distract other students and keep you from fully engaging with the class activities.

Participation: The class is going to be a combination of lectures and in-class activities. Participation
is highly encouraged to keep the class interactive. All questions are good questions. You are all here to
learn and your question might help other students. We are all responsible for creating a safe and collaborative learning environment. For doing so, I expect you to respect each other ideas and learning process.

Communication: If you need to communicate with me, please come to my office hours or send me an
email. If you have time conflicts with my office hours, email me and we can arrange another time to meet.

I am committed to replying to your emails within 24 hours on weekdays. For emails sent after 5:00 pm on
Fridays, please allow until Monday morning.

In this course we will use Piazza as the main source of communication. Piazza should be used for general
course-related questions that may interest others in the class. The quicker you begin asking questions, the
quicker you’ll benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. We encourage you
to ask questions when you’re struggling to understand a concept.

The course also has between 3-5 hours of office hours each week. We will adjust the number of office hours
depending on student participation in this space. We strongly encourage you to attend office hours! If you
are unable to attend office hours please send me an email and we can find an alternative time to meet.

Assessment
Project: You will work on a group project throughout the course. The main objective of the project is to
create a cohesive analysis in the form of a dashboard or data story from a given dataset. This assignment
is significant and time-consuming, as it tests various aspects of the course. To ensure that all teams receive
feedback throughout the mini, the project will have weekly assignments, including a final report and a final
presentation. The final presentation and report will happen at the end of the semester on Week 7 (02/27).

There will be special guests on the final presentations. Specific details of the project and the weekly deliverables can be found on the Course Project Canvas page. In order to give you helpful and prompt feedback
from Prof. Barrios and the TAs, no late assignment are allowed for the projects.

For the project, teams will be assigned by the professor to guarantee that a mix of disciplines is represented
ineachteam. Teamsconsistoftwoorthreestudents. Allstudentslistedonateamsubmissionareexpected
to contribute meaningfully to the assignment. If you have not contributed to the team, you are expected to
submit an individual presentation and report.

In-class activities - case studies: To gain hands-on learning experience, we will work on in-class case
studies. Some of these case studies will have an individual deliverable, and some will have a group deliverable. These assignments are designed to help students practice and apply class content through small
challenges. Students will work with others in randomly assigned groups to complete the case study, which
will be evaluated based on effort, not accuracy. Groups will have the opportunity to attempt and discuss
these challenges and later share their findings with the rest of the class. This will allow everyone to learn
from each other’s diverse experiences and backgrounds. Students will be able to access a solutions after the
case studies have been submitted. Class activities are meant to be finished in class; by the end of class you
should submit your work regardless of how much is completed.

In-class activities - follow along: During lecture time, students will be expected to follow along with
the Tableau exercise demonstrated in class. While follow-along are meant to be finished during class time,
students will have until the next day to submit their work. That is, if the follow-along is on a Tuesday, you
have until Wednesday at midnight to submit your work, if the follow-along is on a Thursday, you have until
Friday at midnight to submit your work. This allows students to have more time to complete the Tableau
follow-along,accountingforthefactthattheymightsometimesexperiencetechnicaldifficultiesduringclass,
fall behind in the demonstration, or need more time to refine their work. These hands-on exercises are a
great way to build up the practical experience you’ll then require for your case study challenge and final
projects.

Class participation: Participation will be graded based on attendance, participation in class activities,
and preparation for class (readings or additional assignments before class). To make the class interactive,
I expect all of you to come prepared to class, engage in class discussions, and share your results from class
activities. Your grade will be based on in-class engagement, both during lectures and contributing to team
activities. The lack of attendance, and the use of mobile devices, including phones and laptops, will count

against your participation grade.

Regrade policy: We are committed to returning work to you as quickly as possible. Our goal is to grade
assignments and return them within one week of the due date. Graded assignments will be available for
review on Gradescope. All appeals for grading must be made within 2 weeks of the due date of the assignments. Please clearly explain why you believe your assignment was not graded correctly. Please use
Gradescope to submit your re-grading request.

Lateassignments: Youcansubmitonelateassignment(notincludingprojectassignments),upto24hours
afterthedeadline,withoutpenalization. Afteryourfirstlateassignment,eachadditionallateassignmentwill
have a deduction of 20% of the points. That is, in your second late assignment you will only be eligible for
80%ofthetotalgrade,inthethirdlateassignmentyouwillonlybeeligiblefor60%ofthepoints,andsoon.

Assignments can not be submitted more than 24 hours after the deadline. Any assignment submitted more
than 24 hours after the deadline will have a grade of zero. However, I understand occasional emergencies
can happen, so please notify me as soon as possible and we can make arrangements for your submission. A
late assignment due to an emergency will not count toward the late assignment policy.

Academic Integrity
You are expected to do the assignments by yourself unless stated otherwise. You are allowed to use AI
generatorsforinspiration, butdo not copy from an AI generator. IfyouusedanAIgenerator, mention
it in your project report or case study/ class assignment submission. You are not allowed to use an AI
generator to do any of your written submissions. In accordance with CMU policy, it is the responsibility
of each student to produce her/his own original academic work. (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/studentand-student-life/academic-integrity.html) If there is evidence that you copy from another student or an AI
generator (or did not report using it), you will receive zero credit for the assignment and face academic
sanctions according to the University policies. You are encouraged and expected to familiarize yourself with
the University policy. If you have any questions please contact me or the TA.

Performance evaluation
The final grade for the course will consist of grades from the items mentioned above and will be weighted as
follows:
60% Project
10% In-class activities - case studies
15% In-class activities - follow along
15% Class participation
### Your final grade will be determined by your placement on the following scale:

# 98-100 A+ 80-82.99 B95-97.99 A 77-79.99 C+

90-94.99 A- 73 – 76.99 C
87-89.99 B+ 70-72.99 C83-86.99 B . 0-69.99 R
Please note that I do not round up. For example, to get an A in the class, you have to get a 95% or higher.

Other information
Accommodation
If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage
you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work
with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a
disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability
Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Well being
School can be challenging at times. Make sure to take time for yourself and do activities you enjoy. The
University Provost provides the following thoughts that I believe are important to share.

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve
your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus
and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner
rather than later is almost always helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is
here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website athttp://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reachingouttoafriend, facultyorfamilymemberyoutrustforhelpgettingconnectedtothesupportthatcanhelp.

Inclusion and Diversity
We must treat every individual with respect. We at Heinz College, and Carnegie Mellon University, are diverseinmanyways,andthisdiversityisfundamentaltobuildingandmaintaininganequitableandinclusive
campus community. Inclusion is ensuring everyone feels respected in the environments they interact with
other. Diversity,canbebroadlydefinedasthepresenceofpeoplewhoidentifywithmultipleattributes,these
include but are not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation,
genderidentity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteranstatus, orgeneticinformation. Eachofthesediverse
identities,alongwithmanyothersnotmentionedhere,shapetheperspectivesourstudents,faculty,andstaff
bring to our campus. I will work to promote and create an inclusive and equitable learning environment. I
understand that diverse backgrounds require different learning tools and I am committed to provide each of
you with the tools you need to grow and learn in my class.

We, atCMU,willworktopromotediversity, equityandinclusionnotonlybecausediversityfuelsexcellence
andinnovation,butbecausewewanttopursuejustice. Weacknowledgeourimperfectionswhilewealsofully
commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community
that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive
environment. The university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on
the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the
incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:
*  Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
*  Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a report by calling 844587-0793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com.

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to
be more equitable and just.
