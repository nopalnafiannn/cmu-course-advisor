Professor: Silvia Borzutzky
Email: sb6n@andrew.cmu.edu
Office: 2112 Hamburg Hall. I will have office hours via zoom. Please email me for a

Course Objectives
The goal of this course is to examine critical international policies, issues, and actors. The
different sections of the course will discuss:
1.-U.S. Foreign Policy: Current policies including our relationship with China, Iran,
India, Russia and selected African and Latin American countries will be discussed
throughout the course.

2.-The section on China will provide a detailed analysis of China’s economic and
military transformation into a major international power in the last thirty years. This
section will focus on China’s economic and defense policies, China’s role in the world
economy and the impact of President’s Xi’s policies both domestically and
internationally will be analyzed as well.

3.-China-U.S. Relations will receive special attention. Among the topics discussed will
be power competition in the S. China Sea and in South and East Asia, as well as ChinaU.S. economic relations.

4.-The section on Russia will include a brief background and a discussion of Russia’s
current role in the international economic and political system. We’ll focus the analysis
on Mr. Putin’s current policies in Ukraine and past policies in Syria.

5.-Latin America and Africa’s interactions with both China and the U.S. will be
discussed in the last section of the class.

What do you get from this course?
a) Knowledge
### At the end of the course, the students are expected to have:

a) Learned the main analytic methods and approaches used in international relations.
b) Learned about U.S. Foreign policies and actions in several regions of the world.
c) Acquired an in-depth knowledge of the nature of the Chinese government, its
approach to foreign policy, as well as China’s impact on the world political and
economic systems.
d) Learned about U.S.-China military and economic relations.
e) Learned about the end of the Soviet Union, Russia under Putin and the invasion of
Ukraine.
f) Learned about Latin American and African countries’ relations with China and
the U.S.
b) Analytical Skills:
The course emphasizes the development of analytical skills. Students will develop these
analytical skills in three different forms and through four different processes:
a) Class discussions will allow the students to develop the ability to analyze,
discuss, and defend different policy positions in an academic environment.
b) Writing policy memos: It is critical for all of us to be able to summarize a
problem, present possible solutions, and recommend policies/solutions to others.

The policy memos allow the students to develop these very important skills. The
policy memos emphasize the use of relevant data, the analysis of the problem, and
the policy design.
c) Group presentations: Group presentations are geared to allow the student to
develop the ability to work on a project with other students, learn about a specific
topic in depth, and prepare a class presentation using either power point. To
ensure the effectiveness of the presentation the instructor meets with the student
about ten days before the presentation to set the specific topics and parameters of
the presentation. A draft of the PowerPoint should be submitted to the instructor
no later than 48 hours before the presentation. The slides will be reviewed by the
instructor to verify the effectiveness of the presentation. The group is encouraged
to debate alternative policy positions, if applicable.

The paper will be due 12 days after the presentation. Specific instructions will
be provided to the lass and to each group.

Conclusion
At the end of the course, the students would have learnt about the specific foreign
policies included in the syllabus, the principles and the motivations that inform those
policies. Students would also have developed a set of analytical, presentation and writing
skills.

Additional Information
Take care of yourself.

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will
help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are
many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college
experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is
often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or
feelings such as anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can
help.

Here is information about the Student Academic Success Center (SASC)
SASC focuses on creating spaces for students to engage in their coursework and
approach learning through a variety of group and individual options. We offer many
opportunities for students to deepen their understanding of who they are as learners,
communicators, and scholars. Our services and workshops are free to the CMU
community and meet the needs of all disciplines and levels of study. SASC programs to
support student learning include the following (program titles link to webpages):
● Academic Coaching--This program provides holistic, one-on-one peer support and
group workshops to help undergraduate and graduate students implement habits for
success. Academic Coaching assists students with time management, productive
learning and study habits, organization, stress management, and other skills. Request
an initial consultation here.
● Peer Tutoring--Peer Tutoring is offered in two formats for students seeking support
related to their coursework. Drop-In tutoring targets our highest demand courses
through regularly scheduled open tutoring sessions during the fall and spring
semesters. Tutoring by appointment consists of ongoing individualized and small
group sessions. You can utilize tutoring to discuss course related content, clarify and
ask questions, and work through practice problems. Visit the webpage to see courses
currently being supported by Peer Tutoring.
● Communication Support--Communication Support offers free one-on-one
communication consulting as well as group workshops to support strong written, oral,
and visual communication in texts including IMRaD and thesis-driven essays, datadriven reports, oral presentations, posters and visual design, advanced research,
application materials, grant proposals, business and public policy documents, data
visualisation, and team projects. Appointments are available to undergraduate and
graduate students from any discipline at CMU. Schedule an appointment (in-person
or video), attend a workshop, or consult handouts or videos to strengthen
communication skills. Specific resources for multilingual students are also available.
● Language and Cross-Cultural Support--This program supports students seeking
help with language and cross-cultural skills for academic and professional success
through individual and group sessions. Students can get assistance with writing
academic emails, learning expectations and strategies for clear academic writing,
pronunciation, grammar, fluency, and more. Make an appointment with a Language
Development Specialist to get individualized coaching.
● Supplemental Instruction (SI)--This program offers a non-remedial approach to
learning in historically difficult courses at CMU. It utilizes a peer-led group study
approach to help students succeed and is facilitated by an SI leader, a CMU student
who has successfully completed the course. SI offers a way to connect with other
students studying the same course, a guaranteed weekly study time that reinforces
learning and retention of information, as well as a place to learn and integrate study
tools and exam techniques specific to a course. Visit the website to see courses with
SI available here.
### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources
office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in
the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are
provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit
from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I
encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Writing Support: Feel free to get in touch with the Global Communication Center
(GCC) if you need writing support. You can schedule appointments by emailing the gcccmu@andrew.cmu.edu
