### External Relations: Fundraising & Philanthropy 1

Winter 2025 (Syllabus Updated: 1/13/25)
Course Information
Course Number: 93-826
Meeting Time: Tuesdays, 6:30pm – 9:20pm
Location: Zoom HBH 1202
Instructor: Jamie McMahon, CFRE (jmcmaho1@andrew.cmu.edu)
Office Hours: Can be arranged either in person or by phone
Teaching Assistant: Rachel Gunning (rgunning@andrew.cmu.edu)
Course Description
This course introduces the distinctive qualities of American philanthropy, and explores the roles and
responsibilities you will have as a professional fundraiser, leader, or as a staff member in a non-profit
arts organization. In this fundamentals course the focus is on individual donors - their motivations,
sources of contributed funds, and new and emerging fundraising techniques, although we will also
explore the broad philanthropic landscape as a whole. Additional topics include legal requirements
and ethical considerations that are important to fundraising, effective data management and its
effects on the success of your fundraising efforts, solicitation strategies and effective communication
with donors, and the principles of donor centered fundraising. We will explore the idea of a nonprofit environment in transition, an environment where the fields of arts and culture compete with
social services, education, and global philanthropic needs for a limited pool of dollars; where we are
under increasing pressure to make the case for relevance and civic stature; where our funders -
whether individual philanthropists, foundations, corporations, or government - have changing and
higher expectations around both involvement and accountability.

Course Objectives
By the end of this course you will understand the basic principles of a number of specific topics in
fundraising. Specific learning objectives include:
### *  Describe the history of philanthropy in the United States, the legal framework for nonprofit

organizations, and current issues affecting the nonprofit sector.
### *  Summarize the reasons and motivations why an individual might choose to make a charitable

gift to a nonprofit organization.
### *  Define the basic models of fundraising and giving including the donor pyramid and donor

cycle.
### *  Comprehend the way that the annual fund is the basis for donor acquisition, organizational

financial stability, and further fundraising across the life of the donor.
### *  Formulate a compelling donor solicitation letter and acknowledgement for a donor after a

gift is made.
### *  Understand the nuances of ethical dilemmas that arise in a fundraising context and how

professionals can make appropriate decisions.
### *  Compare different models for creating a development office as well as the back-end

operations needed to run such an office successfully.
### *  Reflect on the value of fundraising for your own career plans in the arts or elsewhere and

how you might utilize the principles discussed in this course.

Course Materials
Textbook: Sargeant, A., Shang, J., & Associates (2017). Fundraising principles and practice (2nd ed.).

Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Additional Materials: These will be assigned throughout the course and will be available on Canvas or
through the CMU library system.

Prerequisites
None.

Course Requirements
Attendance: You are required to attend all class sessions. If you have a need to miss class or are ill,
please contact your instructors or TA via email as far in advance as possible. Make up work may be
assigned at the instructor’s discretion and your participation grade may be lowered if you are not in
class without a valid reason. This course is offered on ground in person and will not be streamed via
Zoom unless at the instructor’s discretion.

Class Participation: Peer learning is an important component of this course. Every student will
contribute to the learning process for every other student at some point during the term. Therefore,
active participation in class assignments, discussions, and group exercises, as well as asking questions
of guest speakers, is essential for success in this course.

Response Forms (200-300 words each): Completing the assigned reading before class is essential
to ensure that everyone is starting on the same page for our conversation. Since this is a graduate
level course, we will assume that you have done the reading and will come to class prepared to
engage in discussion. Completion of the Response Forms is a student’s ticket to attend class, and
they are due (via Canvas) to the TA before the beginning of each class meeting. This course
requirement is aimed at ensuring lively and insightful discussion during meetings of the class.

Students are expected to use examples from the readings to support their responses. The questions
to be answered will be posted on Canvas.

Acknowledgement (350-500 words) Letter: As director of development, write an
acknowledgement letter to thank Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Donor (123 Philanthropy Avenue,
Pittsburgh, PA 15213) for a $10,000 gift to fund an arts education program of your choosing. As part
of the recognition for their gift, the donors attended a celebration gala where they were served a fivecourse dinner. The donors were solicited for this gift by the CEO and Board Chair of your nonprofit
organization. The letter must both suffice for tax documentation purposes as well as explaining the
impact their gift had on the organization in a compelling manner. (Due February 11 – Full
assignment will be discussed in class)
Philanthropist Presentation: In groups of 2-3 students, make a 12-minute presentation to the class
on a group of assigned philanthropists. This presentation should give a brief overview of each person
but more importantly draw links and connections between each of their different philanthropic
endeavors and motivations. (Presentations will be made in class on February 25)
Reflection Paper (750-1250 words): Write a paper reflecting on your experiences in this course and
ways that you might utilize the principles of fundraising and philanthropy in your proposed career in
the arts, or other career plans that you may have. Incorporate ideas and themes from at least three

### Course Policies and Expectations:

Writing: Written work will be assessed on both the degree to which it addresses the assignment, but
also on the use of correct spelling, grammar, and appropriate professional style.

Late Assignments: Assignments not received by the due date will drop one grade level (e.g. A- to
B+) for each 24-hour period that they are late. For an exemption to this policy, please inform the
instructor as soon as possible of the reason (e.g. illness, family emergency, etc.) by email.

Electronic Devices: If you wish to take notes on a laptop during class that is acceptable; the
instructor will notice if you appear distracted by non-academic matters. Aside from this, phones and
other devices should be stowed away during class.

Food and Drink in Class: Studies show that adult learners do well if refreshments are available.

Please feel free to bring food or drink to class; please clean up after yourself.

Cheating and Plagiarism: Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as
extremely serious matters. Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as
among the most serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a
required paper or as cheating on an examination, including take-home as well as in-class
examinations. The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the MAM program and
Heinz College.
### Cheating includes but is not necessarily limited to:

● Plagiarism, explained below.
● Submission of work that is not the student's own for papers, assignments or exams.
● Submission or use of falsified data.

### External Relations: Fundraising & Philanthropy 4

Winter 2025 (Syllabus Updated: 1/13/25)
● Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam.
● Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination.
● Use of unauthorized material including textbooks, notes or computer programs in the
preparation of an assignment or during an examination.
● Supplying or communicating in any way unauthorized information to another student for the
preparation of an assignment or during an examination.
● Collaboration in the preparation of an assignment. Unless specifically permitted or required
by the instructor, collaboration will usually be viewed by the university as cheating. Each
student, therefore, is responsible for understanding the policies of the department offering
any course as they refer to the amount of help and collaboration permitted in preparation of
assignments.
● Submission of the same work for credit in two courses without obtaining the permission of
the instructors beforehand.

Plagiarism is the failure to indicate the source of work – either with quotation marks or footnotes.

The source can be a phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific language, or an idea derived from the
work of another person. Note that material on the web is another person’s work and is therefore
equally subject to the rules on plagiarism and cheating as any other source material.

You are welcome to use generative AI programs (ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc.) in this course. These
programs can be powerful tools for learning and other productive pursuits, including completing
some assignments in less time, helping you generate new ideas, or serving as a personalized learning
tool.

However, your ethical responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow CMU’s
academic integrity policy. Note that this policy applies to all uncited or improperly cited use of
content, whether that work is created by human beings alone or in collaboration with a generative
AI. If you use a generative AI tool to develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite the
tool’s contribution to your work. In practice, cutting and pasting content from any source without
citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing content from a generative AI without citation is
plagiarism. Similarly, using any generative AI tool without appropriate acknowledgement will be
treated as plagiarism.
### Here are some specific expectations for your use of AI generation tools in this course:

### *  You can include AI generated content verbatim into a writing assignment with quotations

and a citation.
*  You can paraphrase AI generated content with a citation.
*  You can include non-text AI generated content (images, video, code, etc.) with an
appropriate citation, when expressly permitted in the assignment prompt.
### *  You will conduct your own research and generate bibliographies yourself for topics that you

have researched.
*  You will not use or present generative AI content that you pass off as your own work.

Finally, it is important that you recognize that generative AI tools frequently provide users with
incorrect information, create professional-looking citations that are not real, generate contradictory
statements, incorporate copyrighted material without appropriate attribution, and sometimes
integrate biased or offensive concepts. Code generation models may produce inaccurate outputs.

Image generation models may create misleading or offensive content.

While you may use these tools in the work you create for this class, it is important to note that you

### External Relations: Fundraising & Philanthropy 5

Winter 2025 (Syllabus Updated: 1/13/25)
understand you are ultimately responsible for the content that you submit. Work that is
inaccurate, biased, unethical, offensive, plagiarized, or incorrect will be treated as such during the
evaluation of your work.

Cheating and/or plagiarism on an assignment will result in a failing grade (zero points) for
that assignment. The assignment in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the
offending student’s assignments included in grade calculations; the points for that piece of work –
zero (0) – will be factored into the grade. Furthermore, the cheating student’s final grade will be
reduced one full letter grade. A cheating student’s final grade will be impacted significantly. In
addition, all cases of cheating and plagiarism are submitted to and reviewed by the Dean’s Office,
which reserves the right to impose more severe penalties, up to and including expulsion from the
Heinz School.

Statement on Diversity
We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is
fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity
can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national
origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry,
belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others
not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We,
at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels
excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections
while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and
sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional.

They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the
university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile
treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the
incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following
resources:
*  Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
*  Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a report by
calling 844-587-0793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com.

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions.

Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus
climate to be more equitable and just.

Food Insecurity
If you are worried about affording food or feeling insecure about food, there are resources on
campus that can help. Any undergraduate or graduate student can visit the CMU Pantry and receive
food for free. Follow the directions on the CMU Pantry website to schedule your visit.
