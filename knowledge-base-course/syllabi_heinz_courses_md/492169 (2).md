Course Description
Individuals and organizations are frequently presented with decisions about how best to allocate
limited resources. Public organizations in particular have an obligation to use consistent and
transparent analytic tools to inform tradeoffs among competing policy priorities such as the
environment, health, safety, and security. Economics provides a theoretical foundation for the
allocation of scarce resources, but in practice, there are a variety of challenges in measuring
benefits and costs in quantitative and monetary terms. Such challenges include determining how
to value benefits and costs experienced in the future, reductions in the risk of premature death and
injury, and the distribution of these impacts among affected populations, as well as appropriately
characterizing uncertainty. The ability to assess key assumptions and limitations is critical for
both producers and consumers of cost-benefit analysis.

Learning Objectives
Through case studies, discussions, readings, lectures, problem sets, written assignments, and
presentations, students will develop knowledge and skills that will enable them to:
*  Understand and identify the assumptions and limitations of cost-benefit analyses.
*  Critically assess cost-benefit analyses conducted by others.
### *  Evaluate and compare alternative policies using the tools of cost-benefit analysis and

microeconomics.
### *  Communicate the results of the cost-benefit analysis to stakeholders in such a way as to

facilitate political or administrative processes.
### *  Apply the analytic tools and techniques of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics in

the formulation and assessment of real-world policies.
*  Contribute to the development of defensible and transparent cost-benefit analyses.

The learning objectives above will be evaluated by completion of the course requirements below.

Course Requirements
### Course grades will be based on the following requirements:

## 1. Class participation and engagement (35 percent)

### *  In addition to completing reading assignments for each class, active participation in class

discussion and acceptance of cold calls in class are expected.
### *  For certain classes, students may be asked to complete a discussion problem in advance

of the class. Students will sometimes be asked to submit responses electronically in
advance of class. We will ask 1-2 students to volunteer to lead the class discussion for
the problem for each class.
### *  The participation and engagement grade will depend on regular attendance and active

involvement in class discussions, presentations, and discussion problems. Students are
expected to attend all classes, but may be granted an excused absence that could include
an illness or personal emergency or an apprenticeship-related travel/opportunity worked
out in advance of the missed class. Please try not to miss class, as class discussions and
lectures are the most important source of information for the final project. If you are late
or have to miss class, please be sure to get notes from a classmate and download relevant
materials from Canvas.
## 2. CBA in the News (10 percent)

### *  Students will organize into pairs to prepare a short presentation (5-10-minutes) about

contemporary cost-benefit analysis issues in the news, drawn from a current newspaper,
magazine, or journal article selected by each student. Beyond being related to costbenefit analysis, the only requirement for selecting the issues is that it interests you!
*  Beginning on January 23, each class 2-3 pairs of students will be presenting. The
Teaching Assistant will organize the schedule of presentations; please let the Teaching
Assistant know when you would like to present.
## 3. Problem sets (20 percent)

### *  There will be two problem sets that will include work on spreadsheets and computer

models and simulations.
### *  Collaboration on problem sets must not include the preparation of final answers: all

students must write up their answers independently. This means that problem set
collaboration is limited to discussion only, perhaps with the help of a white board or
scrap paper. No text, Excel formula, or equation should be copied verbatim in the
process, and no student should share his or her write-ups with others. While students may
share a common approach and even final numeric solutions, all write-ups must be
independent. That said, be open and generous in your discussions; helping others is a
good thing in CBA, as in life.
## 4. Final Project (35 percent)

### *  The final project for this course requires students to organize into several small groups to

analyze real-world cost-benefit analyses, and then to prepare and deliver a memo that
evaluates the CBA and a presentation of the group’s evaluation in class on February 27th.
### *  Each group will select a completed cost-benefit analysis to analyze from among a sample

provided in class.

Late assignments are penalized 10 points immediately and then 10 additional points for each
additional 24-hour period.

Course Materials
There is no required textbook for the course. However, a number of the classes will include
selections from the following text:
*  Cost-benefit Analysis: Concepts and Practice (Boardman, A.E., D.H. Greenberg, A.R.

Vining, and D.L. Weimer, 2011, Fourth Edition). Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Pearson.

The text is available for purchase online at Amazon.

Although the required selections from the text will be posted on Canvas, students may wish to
purchase the text for additional reading beyond the selections provided.

In addition to the text, other readings will include case studies, journal articles, book chapters,
and published cost-benefit analyses. As with the selections from the text, these materials will be
posted to the course page on Canvas. The case studies, in particular, are copyrighted and
permission to use these materials is obtained through the College at a discounted rate so they can
be easily shared with the course roster. Your student account will be charged a nominal fee to
cover the cost of these materials. Please see the Heinz College handbook for further information.

The syllabus and reading list may be revised throughout the semester and all updates will be
announced in class and posted on Canvas.

Student Well-Being
The past few years have been unlike any others. We are all under a lot of stress and uncertainty
at this time. Attending Zoom classes all day can take its toll on our mental health.

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well,
exercising, getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your
goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are
many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the university experience is
learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always
helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like
anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and
Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at
http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member
you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.

Use of Electronic Devices during Class
This semester CBA will be in remote-only format and so it involves the regular use of
technology during class. Research has shown that divided attention is detrimental to learning, so
please close any windows not directly related to what we are doing while you are in class.

Please also turn off your phone notifications and limit other likely sources of technology
disruption, so you can fully engage with the material, each other, and me. This will create a
better learning environment for everyone.

Academic Integrity
Students are expected to honor the letter and the spirit of the Carnegie Mellon University Policy
on Academic Integrity. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with this policy.

Students are also encouraged to review the Carnegie Mellon University Academic Disciplinary
Actions Overview for Graduate Students, which details penalties and sanctions, as well as
students’ rights. Departmental leadership will be consulted on appropriate action for all
violations of the Policy on Academic Integrity.

Certain assignments in this course will permit or even encourage the use of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT. When AI use is permissible, it will be clearly stated in
the assignment prompt posted in Canvas. Otherwise, the default is that use of generative AI is
disallowed. In assignments where generative AI tools are allowed, their use must be
appropriately acknowledged and cited. For instance, if you generated the whole document
through ChatGPT and edited it for accuracy, your submitted work would need to include a note
such as “I generated this work through Chat GPT and edited the content for accuracy.”
Paraphrasing or quoting smaller samples of AI generated content must be appropriately
acknowledged and cited, following the guidelines established by the APA Style Guide. It is each
student’s responsibility to assess the validity and applicability of any AI output that is submitted.

You may not earn full credit if inaccurate or invalid information is found in your work.

Deviations from the guidelines above will be considered violations of CMU’s academic integrity
policy. Note that expectations for “plagiarism, cheating, and acceptable assistance” on student
work may vary across your courses and instructors. Please email me if you have questions
regarding what is permissible and not for the course or a particular assignment.

Students
Diversity Statement
We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is
fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community.

Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race,
color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion,
creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities,
along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and
staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not
only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice.

We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside
of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces
these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. Unfortunately,
incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They
contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university.

Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile
treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the
incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following
resources:
*  Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
*  Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: reportit.net username: tartans
password: plaid
All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following
actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform
our campus climate to be more equitable and just.
