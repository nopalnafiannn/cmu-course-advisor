Course Description
This class will provide an introduction to coding in R, a widely used statistical programming language.

Students will learn to import, export, and manipulate datasets with different data types. Students will analyze the datasets using common statistical methods. For example, they will design, construct, and interpret
statistical models and produce a variety of different customized graphical outputs. Throughout the course,
students will create scripts and generate reproducible reports. There will be a focus on using these tools in
public policy areas through examples and a class project.

The format for this course will be a combination of weekly lectures and interactive in-class activities that
will allow students to practice the material taught. At the end of the course, you will be able to understand
coding structures and create your own code. The project will allow you to identify and develop an analytical model that contributes to policy design, and communicate your result to a technical and non-technical
audience.

A good knowledge of statistics is preferred, but this course is for anyone wanting to learn the basics of the
R language and how to use the tools R offers to be able to do basic data analysis, statistical calculations,
create graphical output, and generate reproducible reports using R Markdown.

Course Objectives
### At the end of this course, you should be able to:

*  Understand and reproduce coding structures.
*  Use R with RStudio, find and understand R documentation, and write functional scripts.
*  Produce statistical summaries of continuous and categorical data.
*  Produce basic graphics and advanced graphics using different packages.

*  Perform basic statistical and hypothesis tests.
*  Develop classification and regression models and interpret the results.
*  Create reproducible reports in R Markdown.
### *  Communicate your analysis and results in a creative way to a non-technical audience

Course Resources
Please go to the Canvas page “R resources” to find a list of resources and instructions on how to download
R and RStudio. You will also find a list of books and links that can help you throughout the class.

Class expectations
Attendance: Classattendanceismandatory. Studentsmaymisstwolectureswithnopenalty. Ifyouanticipate more absences, please speak with me as early as possible. The best way to learn R is by creating code,
makingmistakes,andfindingwaystoproduceresults. Lectureswillbeinteractivewithstudentsencouraged
to use their laptops/computers to connect and participate in the course as well as run R code and follow
along with real time exercises. We will work on simple example problems that will help you understand
the material. If you miss a class, you are responsible for checking the lecture slides/notes on Canvas and
obtaining any additional class material from another student or me. You can request the material from me
through email or in person at office hours. Beware that the material of this course is cumulative. Thus,
catching up on time will allow you to follow up in the classes following the one you missed. If you miss a
class the day an assignment is due, please make sure you make prearranged plans to submit the assignment
on time and prevent points being deducted. The late assignment policy can be found in the Assessment
section of this syllabus.

Classroom behavior: Please arrive on time. If you arrive after the class has started, please enter quietly
to avoid distracting other students and interrupting the lecture. Laptops, and ipads are permitted in class
for taking notes or for class activities. Please refrain from using cellphones or electronics for other purposes
during class. This might distract other students and keep you from fully understanding the material.

Participation: The class is going to be a combination of lectures and in-class activities. Participation is
highly encouraged to keep the class interactive. All questions are good questions. You are all here to learn
and your question might help other students. We are all responsible for creating a safe and collaborative
learning environment. For doing so, I expect you to respect each other learning process.

Communication: If you need to communicate with me, please come to my office hours or send me an
email. If you have time conflicts with my office hours, email me and we can arrange another time to me. I
am committed to replying to your emails within 24 hours on weekdays.

Assessment
In-class activities - follow along: Duringlecturetime, studentswillbeexpectedtofollowalongwiththe
exercise demonstrated in class. While follow-along are meant to be finished during class time, students will
have until the next day to submit their work. That is, if the follow-along is on a Tuesday, you have until
Wednesday at midnight to submit your work, if the follow-along is on a Thursday, you have until Friday
at midnight to submit your work. This allows students to have more time to complete the follow-along,
accounting for the fact that they might sometimes experience technical difficulties during class, fall behind
in the demonstration, or need more time to refine their work. These hands-on exercises are a great way to
build up the practical experience you’ll then require for your case study challenge and final projects.

In-class activities - case studies: To gain hands-on learning experience, we will work on in-class case
studies. Some of these case studies will have an individual deliverable, and some will have a group deliverable. These assignments are designed to help students practice and apply class content through small
challenges. Students will work with others in randomly assigned groups to complete the case study. Students will be able to access a solution after the case studies have been submitted. Class activities are meant
tobefinishedinclass;bytheendofclass,youshouldsubmityourworkregardlessofhowmuchiscompleted.

Quizzes: There will be 2 short quizzes scheduled on Week 3 and Week 6. The purpose of these quizzes is
to assess understanding of various concepts that are central to the class.

Project: Thefinalprojectfortheclasswillaskyoutoexploreabroadpolicyquestionusingalargepublicly
availabledatasetofyourchoosing. Thisprojectisintendedtoprovidestudentswiththecompleteexperience
of going from a study question and a rich data set to a full statistical report. Students will be expected to
(a) explore the data to identify important variables, (b) perform statistical analyses to address the policy
question, (c) produce tabular and graphical summaries to support their findings, and (d) write a report
describing their methodological approach, findings, and limitations.

To help you with the project process and load you will have weekly assignments. These assignments will
allow us to guide you throughout the course of your project and answer any questions along the way.

You can find a detailed project description on Canvas. While students may work in small groups to decide
on appropriate statistical methodology and graphical/tabular summaries, each student will be required to
produce and submit their own code and final report.

Class participation: Participationwillbegradedbasedonattendanceandparticipationinclassactivities.

This include but is not limited to questions asked in class, completing class activities, being engaged with
the class discussion. To make the class interactive, I expect all of you to come prepared to class, engage in
class discussions, and share your results from class activities.

Regrade policy: We are committed to returning work to you as quickly as possible. Our goal is to grade
assignmentsandreturnthemwithin1weekoftheduedate. Gradedassignmentswillbeavailableforpickup
attherecitationsessionsandattheendofthelectures. Allappealsforgradingmustbemadewithin2weeks
oftheduedateoftheassignments. Theappealmustbewrittenandincludethenumberofthequestionwith
the specific reason why you believe the grade is incorrect. You must submit the original graded paper with
the written appeal to one of the TA’s after class or during office hours. Please check the homework solution
before appealing.

Late assignments: You can submit one late assignment, up to 24 hours after the deadline, without penalization. After your first late assignment, each additional late assignment will have a deduction of 20% of
the points. That is, in your second late assignment you will only be eligible for 80% of the total grade, in
the third late assignment you will only be eligible for 60% of the points, and so on. Assignments can not
be submitted more than 24 hours after the deadline. Any assignment submitted more than 24 hours after
the deadline will have a grade of zero. However, I understand occasional emergencies can happen, so please
notify me as soon as possible and we can make arrangements for your submission. A late assignment due to
an emergency will not count toward the late assignment policy.

Academic Integrity
You are expected to do the assignments by yourself unless stated otherwise. You are allowed to use AI
generatorsforcodingorinspiration,butdo not copy from an AI generator. IfyouusedanAIgenerator,
mention it in your project report or case study/ class assignment submission. You are not allowed to use an
AI generator to do any of your written submissions. In accordance with CMU policy, it is the responsibility
of each student to produce her/his own original academic work. (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/studentand-student-life/academic-integrity.html) If there is evidence that you copy from another student or an AI
generator, or did not report using it, you will receive zero credit for the assignment and face academic

sanctions according to the University policies. You are encouraged and expected to familiarize yourself with
the University policy. If you have any questions please contact me or the TA.

Accommodation
If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage
you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work
with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a
disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability
Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Well being
Graduateschoolcanbechallengingattimes. Makesuretotaketimeforyourselfanddoactivitiesyouenjoy.

The University Provost provides the following thoughts that I believe are important to share.

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve
your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus
and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner
rather than later is almost always helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is
here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website athttp://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reachingouttoafriend, facultyorfamilymemberyoutrustforhelpgettingconnectedtothesupportthatcanhelp.

Inclusion and Diversity
We must treat every individual with respect. We at Heinz College are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Inclusion

is ensuring everyone feels respected in the environments they interact with other. Diversity, can be broadly
defined as the presence of people who identify with multiple attributes, these include but are not limited to
race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed,
ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many
others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. I
will work to promote and create an inclusive and equitable learning environment. I understand that diverse
backgrounds require different learning tools and I am committed to provide each of you with the tools you
need to grow and learn in my class.

We, atCMU,willworktopromotediversity, equityandinclusionnotonlybecausediversityfuelsexcellence
andinnovation,butbecausewewanttopursuejustice. Weacknowledgeourimperfectionswhilewealsofully
commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community
that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive
environment. The university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on
the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the
incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:
*  Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
*  Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a report by calling 844587-0793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com.

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to
be more equitable and just.
