Course Syllabus
### Instructor: Michael J. McCarthy

Email: mm6@andrew.cmu.edu
OAicer Hours T.H. 2:00 - 4:00 HBH 3015
### Teaching Assistant: Abhineet Chaudhary

Email: abhineetchaudhary@cmu.edu
OAice Hours: See Canvas under "Home"
Prerequisite: 95-712 Object-oriented Programming in Java or permission of the
instructor.

Grading Scale: 97.5 - 100 A+
92.5 - 97.4 A
90.0 - 92.4 A87.5 - 89.9 B+
82.5 - 87.4 B
80.0 - 82.4 B77.5 - 79.9 C+
72.5 - 77.4 C
70.0 - 72.4 CAssignments: Five or six programming projects 50% (equally weighted, no
collaboration)
Each project will normally consist of several programming
activities.

Five pop quizzes 5% (low quiz score dropped).

Midterm 20% (Closed book)
Final 25% (Closed book and comprehensive)
Late Assignment You have 7 grace days to spend. This policy is meant
Policy: to cover such issues as job interviews, travel and so on. After the
seven days are spent
there is a penalty of 10% per day late.

Policy on Copying code without citing it is cheating.
collaboration and AI Copying code from a fellow student is cheating.
tools:
However, if you cite the source of the code, you may choose to use
a large language model to assist with your programming work.

Note that LLMs often make mistakes. You are responsible for any
errors or problems that may be present in the code that you
submit. The closed book exams are designed to test your
knowledge and coding skills. So, if you do use a large language
model, be sure to master the material and truly understand the
code, before taking an exam.

Be sure to note that you must follow the academic integrity
guidelines of the university. If you use a generative AI tool to
develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite the
toolâ€™s contribution to your work, just as you should cite code
acquired from any other source.

If you copy code from the Web, be sure to provide a comment in
the code with the exact URL where the code was copied from.

Code that is provided by the instructor is allowed as long as the
code is clearly cited as being provided by the instructor. Of course,
if you have violated the spirit of the project, you will earn zero
points.

Policy on grading Grading mistakes may occur. Please contact the TA who graded
complaints: your assignment about grading mistakes. It will be up to the TA to
handle the complaint. If you are still not satisfied with the TA's
grade please contact me immediately. My initial reaction will be to
support the TA's grade. In some cases, however, I might agree with
the student and ask for the grade to be adjusted. Please make any
grading concerns known to the TA immediately. Set up an
appointment with the TA and get the matter resolved.

Use of Canvas There will be a Canvas site for the course. The Piazza links are
located there and will be used as a discussion board. Grades will
be posted there and assignments will be submitted there. It is far
better to post a question to the discussion board than it is to send
your instructor or TA an email. Answers posted there are available
for all to see. The main site for the course (syllabus, course
description and schedule) is this page.

Software The student needs to download and install the most recent IntelliJ
Requirements: Ultimate IDE. Available here.

Time and place: T.R. 11:00 PM to 12:20 PM HBH 1007
FERPA Statement: Some classes may be recorded via Zoom so that students in this
course (and only students in this course) can watch or re-watch
past sessions. Please note that breakout rooms will not be
recorded. Please note that you are not allowed to share these
recordings. This is to protect your FERPA rights and those of your
fellow students.

Recommended Text: Michael Main, Data Structures & Other Objects Using Java Fourth
Edition (Addison-Wesley Longman, ISBN-13 978-0132576246)
Optional Text: Corman, et al., Introduction to Algorithms (1990, MIT Press, ISBN
0262031418)
Learning Objectives: At the completion of this course the student will be able to:
## 1. Design or select an appropriate algorithm for a particular

problem.
## 2. Design or select an appropriate data structures for a particular

problem.
## 3. Write programs that make good use of stacks, queues, linked

lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
## 4. Analyze the runtime performance of algorithms in terms of Big

O, Big Omega, and Big Theta notation.
## 5. Understand worse case, best case, average case and amortized

analysis.
## 6. Understand the distinction between algorithm correctness and

performance.
## 7. Understand the theory of NP-completeness.

## 8. DiAerentiate between problems that are computable and those

that are not.

Good health: Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle
this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and
alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This
will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not
alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and

an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask
for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often
helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress,
diAicult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we
strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and
Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922
and visit their website here. Consider reaching out to a friend,
faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to
the support that can help.
### If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of selfharm, call someone immediately, day or night:

### If the situation is life threatening, call the police:
