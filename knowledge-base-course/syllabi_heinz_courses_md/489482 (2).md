# 95-828
### Machine Learning for Problem Solving

Spring 2025

Course description “95-828 Machine Learning for Problem Solving” explores how machine
learning techniques can be leveraged to address practical challenges in various domains. From
predicting outcomes to optimizing decisions, this course focuses on the entire lifecycle of using
machine learning to solve real-world problems. A key emphasis is on understanding both the
mathematicalfoundationsandpracticalapplications, enablingstudentstonotonlybuildmachine
learning models but also interpret their results and integrate them into actionable strategies.

By working with structured and semi-structured datasets, students will learn to frame problemsolving tasks as machine learning pipelines.

Throughout the course, students will engage with a range of machine learning methods,
from classical models like linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines, to
more advanced approaches, such as deep generative models. In addition to learning algorithmic
techniques, the course also covers important considerations such as model evaluation, handling
bias and variance tradeoffs, and incorporating domain knowledge into model design. Hands-on
programming in Python, utilizing tools like scikit-learn and PyTorch, will be an integral part of
the learning experience. While students are encouraged to use modern tools like large language
models (e.g., ChatGPT) to deepen their understanding and tackle challenges, their use is strictly
prohibited for homework assignments and exams.

Prerequisites Students enrolling in this course are expected to have a good understanding in
basic probability and statistics, linear algebra, and calculus, as these concepts underpin many
of the machine learning techniques covered in this course. Familiarity with programming, particularly in Python, is essential, as the course involves hands-on implementation of algorithms
and data analysis using libraries like scikit-learn and PyTorch. Prior experience with basic data
preprocessing and visualization tools (e.g., pandas, NumPy, matplotlib) will also be beneficial.

While no prior experience in machine learning is required, a willingness to engage with mathematical concepts and apply them to real-world problems is crucial for success in this course.

Course Materials There is no official textbook for the course. I will post all the lecture slides
and related readings on Canvas. You can also find a list of recommended reading below:
□ Foundations of Machine Learning by Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh, and Ameet Talwalkar;
□ Machine learning: A probabilistic perspective by Kevin P. Murphy;
□ AppliedStatisticsandProbabilityforEngineers byDouglasC.MontgomeryandGeorgeC.Runger;
□ Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe.

Grading policy Your grade will be evaluated based on five homework assignments, one course project
and two exams. The grade composition consists of
### *  Five Homework Assignments (5 × 7%)

### *  Team Project (15%)

### *  Midterm Exam (20%)

### *  Final Exam (30%)

Letter grades are determined based on a curve.

Homework There are five homework assignments that give hands-on experience with techniques discussed in class. All assignments involve computational questions and coding in Python with sizable
datasets. WewillusestandardPythonmachinelearninglibrariessuchasscikit-learnandpytorch. Despite
the homework assignments being of varying difficulty, they are equally weighted. Homework assignments
are submitted in Canvas.

Team Project TBD

Exams There will be two closed-book exams and that are each 80 minutes long. You are allowed to
take one A4-size paper of handwritten and double-sided cheat sheet and expected to work on the exam
independently. There are no make-ups; if there is any conflict, please let me and TAs know ASAP and
you may take the exam before the assigned period.

Class attendance and participation The learning process of this class is based on in-class discussion and participation. Attendance and careful preparation of the course material is therefore highly
recommended.

Late submission policy We have the following accommodation policies to help with emergent situations: We will keep track of how many late days you have left based on the submission times of your
homework assignments on Canvas (i.e., you do not have to tell us that you are using a late day as we will
automatically figure this out). This policy only applies to homework; the exams must be submitted on
time to receive any credit. For example: 1. You could use the two late days on two different assignments
to turn them in each 1 day (24 hours) late without penalty; 2. You could use both late days on a
single homework assignment to turn it in 2 days (48 hours) late without penalty. Note that you do not
get fractional late days, e.g., you cannot use 1/2 of a late day to get a 12-hour extension. Once you
have exhausted your late days, work you submit late will not be accepted. This policy only applies to
homework; the exams must be submitted on time to receive any credit.

Communications AllcommunicationfromyourinstructorwilltakeplaceinCanvas. Youareexpected
to check Canvas every day for important course-related information. However, by following the course
instructions, you can also ensure that you do not miss important instructions, announcements, etc. by
adjusting your account settings to receive important information directly to your email account.

For all your administrative requests, such as homework regarding, please email your TA (do not leave
message on Canvas or Piazza). To request a regrade for an assignment, submit a written explanation
to your TA and copy the instructor. Keep in mind that the entire assignment will be reviewed and your
grade may decrease.

For content questions and help, because questions can often be addressed for the good of the group,
please do not email your questions directly to the instructor. Instead, course and content questions will
be addressed on Piazza (Signup at Link with access code “2025”). Feel free to set your post to private
to ask questions about your grade or other issues unique to you. Please be courteous when posting on
Piazza and treat fellow students, TA, and instructor with respect. In the public post, please do not show
any of your answers related to the homework problems, such as code snippets. If you would like to show
the plots (which does not disclose the explicit answer to the questions) from your implementation in the
discussion, please either make them private post (only share with teaching staffs) and/or add watermarks
to those images/results. Please be specific when raising the question. In principle, instructors are not
responsible for the program debugging and will not comment on the pure coding problem. For example,
please do not send the code file to TA or posting a question showing a section of code and asking such
as “why it doesn’t work”.
