# 90-711 Statistical Reasoning with R

Fall 2024
Professor: Dr. Amelia M. Haviland (haviland@cmu.edu)
Head TA: Yingtao Luo (yingtaol)
Lab Director: Zeid El-Kilani (zeklian)
TA Team: Sofia Akhmanaera (sakhmana), Zhenyu Cao (zhenyuc),
Laura Ospina Garnica (lospina), Sophie Golunova (sgolunov),
Pranay Raj Peddareddy (pranayrp), Khushi Shah (khushims), Vincent Wang (vtw)
Statistical reasoning is essential to learning from data and understanding the strengths and
limitations of data analyses. This course is grounded in questions of importance in public policy
and management and focuses on how data and statistical reasoning can inform those questions.

We will use a hands-on approach to develop skills and critical thinking in the fundamentals of
causal inference, univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics, quantifying uncertainty, statistical
inference, and linear regression. The hands-on approach involves learning the basics of how to
use the R statistical language and weekly data analysis labs in which students will use R to carry
out data analysis on real-world policy or management issues in a supervised setting. While
useful, no R or computer programming experience is required for the course, and this course
does not replace the stand-alone R course.

This is a rigorous graduate school introductory statistics and data analysis course, and students
who take this course will be prepared to use (and further develop) statistical reasoning and
methods required for your other courses, your summer internship, your Systems Synthesis
Project, and in your career. In today’s information world, data are available everywhere and the
role of statistics is rapidly increasing in public policy, information security, health care, the arts,
the entertainment industry, business, academia and many other parts of society.
### Format of the Class:

### This class meets In Person. It has two sections:

*  Section A meets 2:00-3:20pm ET Monday and Wednesday with Lab on Fridays at the same time.
*  Section B meets 3:30-4:50pm ET Monday and Wednesday with Lab on Fridays at the same time.

If the class needs to move online, you will receive an email from me (the instructor), and an
announcement will be published on our course website on Canvas. For this course, I will be
recording class sessions (MW) and making them available to you for your educational use.

Recordings of class sessions are covered under the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act
(FERPA) and must not be shared with anyone outside your course-section. The purpose of these
recordings is so students in this course (and only students in this course) can watch (or re-watch)
class sessions. Feel free to use the recordings if you would like to review something we
discussed in class or if you are temporarily unable to attend class.
### Required Text:

Imai, Kosuke and Williams, Nora Webb (2022). Quantitative Social Science: An
## Introduction in Tidyverse. Princeton University Press. Paperback ISBN 978-0-691222288 or eBook ISBN: 978-0-691-222295

It is available in hardcover, paperback, and e-Book. Chapter 1 will be available on the Canvas
site for the class. The chapters of the book that we use in this class are available for 2 hour
check-out at the library – it is an electronic version from scans of the hardcopy.
### Required Software:

In this course we will use the open-source statistical software R (http://www.r-project.org ). R
can be more powerful than other statistical software such as STATA or SAS, but it can also be
challenging to learn. A variety of resources will be made available for 90-711 students in order
to learn R as efficiently as possible. To help make using R easier, we’ll be using RStudio
(http://www.rstudio.com/ )—a user interface that simplifies many common operations and
creates professional quality data analysis reports.

Learning Objectives: Use statistical reasoning to learn from data
▪ Use R and R Studio to explore, summarize, and visualize data.
▪ Apply the concept of potential outcomes to evaluate estimates of causal effects.
▪ Summarize and interpret univariate and bivariate distributions using histograms, box plots, bar
plots, and scatter plots.
▪ Perform linear regression with single or multiple predictors and assess model fit.
▪ Interpret the results of linear regression models.
▪ Use probability to quantify uncertainty in estimators of parameters of interest.
▪ Make accurate statistical inferences using confidence intervals and standard errors.
▪ Appropriately interpret results of data analyses and statistical inferences.
▪ Create reports of data analyses and interpretations of results using R Markdown.
### Grade Components:

15% Weekly Labs – All students are required to synchronously attend the weekly lab sessions. In
these labs you will work with one or two lab partners to complete - in a supervised setting - a
data analysis that uses the concepts covered in class that week and the R skills covered in the
textbook and supplementary materials up to that point. In general, the labs will be more difficult
than but otherwise similar to the HW assigned the same week. Your lab with the lowest grade
each mini will be dropped (i.e. not included in the calculation of your course grade). Details: grade
dropping will occur as stated unless the lowest lab grade occurs the same week as the lowest homework grade, in which case we
will drop the second lowest lab grade.
30% Weekly Homework - For the HW and labs, students are required to create a report of their
work, code, results, and discussion, using Rmarkdown. This Rmarkdown file in turn will be used
to create the report that you will submit for a grade – a final PDF document. The PDF will be
uploaded for grading through an application called GradeScope. Instructions on how to do so
will be provided. Students may discuss the HW assignments in general, but all code, results, and
interpretation of results are to be done individually. The homework assignment with the lowest
grade each mini will be dropped (i.e. not included in the calculation of your course grade). No
late homework assignments will be accepted, hand in what you have and move on.
5% Success Kit Mastery Quizzes – This class focuses on higher level concepts. To make sure all
students are ready to learn those higher level concepts, asynchronous learning materials will be
provided with associated required online quizzes to assess your mastery of the ‘level one’
required concepts, or to provide more practice. The quizzes will be on the course’s Canvas site.

Students are allowed up to three attempts at these short quizzes prior to a deadline. You will
receive credit for completing the quizzes and not completing them will count against you. Your
score does not matter, you receive full credit for taking it, regardless of your score. It is up to
you to take appropriate steps to learn ‘level one’ concepts using the provided materials if your
quiz score indicates to you that you need to.

12.5% each (25% total) In Class Exams – There will be two in class exams held during class
time or labs during the term.
25% Final Exam – There will be a 3-hour cumulative final exam held during the exam period at
the end of the semester.
### Student active learning responsibility:

### We are partners in this learning experience. I EXPECT YOU TO:

### *  Conduct your learning with academic integrity, see below for specifics and definitions

### *  Attend and constructively participate in class and labs

### *  Read assigned textbook sections, take Mastery Quizzes, and address gaps in Level One skills

before class
### *  Do individual homework assignments

### *  Prepare for exams

### *  Be aware of and proactive about your own learning style and time management

*  Pursue your own understanding: What is your understanding? Does it fit with what else you
know? What is solid, missing, or vague? What you can do to make what is missing or vague
more solid: attend office hours, participate in Canvas Discussions, create a study group, review
reading, review homework solutions, make an appointment with the instructor or a TA, and/or
make use of resources at the Student Academic Success Center (SASC).
### Statement Regarding Diversity and Inclusion

We must treat every individual with respect. We at Heinz College are diverse in many
ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive
campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including
but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation,
gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of
these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our
students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, and I as your professor, will work
to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and
innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we
also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a
campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for
creating a safer, more inclusive environment. It is my intent that students from all diverse
backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be
addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be
viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. To enable us to address each other respectfully and
accurately, please record the name you would like us to use for you and your gender pronouns in
NameCoach on Canvas. You can record your name in Canvas --> Account --> Settings --> Name
Recording and Pronouns. Please record your name and pronouns promptly.
### Statement of Support for Students’ Health & Well-being

Your graduate school experience might prove to be exciting, stimulating, and enjoyable, but it is
likely to entail stress as well. The University Provost provides the following thoughts for
students. I consider them important.

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well,
exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This
will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources
available through CMU and an important part of the graduate school experience is learning how
to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like
anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Consider reaching out to a
friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to support. Counseling and
Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website
at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/.
### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office,
I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as
possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If
you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not
yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at
access@andrew.cmu.edu.
### Use of Technology During Class:

This semester involves regular use of technology (computers and statistical software) during lab
and occasionally during class time. Research has shown that divided attention is detrimental to
learning, so I ask that you close any windows not directly related to what we are doing while you
are in lab and refrain from using any technology during class unless specifically instructed to do
so. Please turn off your phone notifications and limit other likely sources of technology
disruption, so you can fully engage with the material, each other, and the instructor. This
will create a better learning environment for everyone. If your technology use is distracting other
students I will intervene (ask you to change what you are doing or leave the class/lab) in order to
maintain a positive learning environment.
### Use of Generative AI for Class:

You are encouraged to use generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) to support your learning of R coding
and statistical reasoning concepts. You are welcome to use a generative AI tool to debug your
code, explain what code does, or suggest code for a task you would like to perform. You are
welcome to ask a generative AI tool to summarize the Weekly R Guide or explain a statistical
concept. In these regards, a generative AI tool can operate as an always available TA.

You may not use generative AI to produce your text answers to any HW or lab questions
submitted for a grade as this cannot be considered a substitute for developing the fundamental
skills outlined in the learning objectives of this class. Please note that generative AI tools rely on
predictive models to generate content that may appear correct, but has been shown to sometimes
be incomplete, inaccurate, taken without attribution from other sources, and/or biased. You are
ultimately responsible for the content of the information you submit and may not attempt to pass
off any work generated by an AI program as your own.
### Academic Integrity:

Students are expected to honor the letter and the spirit of the Carnegie Mellon University Policy
on Cheating and Plagiarism. All activities cited in that policy will be treated as cheating in this
course. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with this policy. In particular, making
any use of prior year HW solutions is an academic integrity violation. Students are also
encouraged to review the Carnegie Mellon University Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview
for Graduate Students, which details penalties and sanctions, as well as students’ rights. I will
take a zero-tolerance policy on cheating and plagiarism and will consult with College leadership
on appropriate action for all instances of cheating and plagiarism. As the aforementioned policies
indicate, penalties can include course failure, suspension, and dismissal from the program.

What constitutes plagiarism in a coding class?1
The course collaboration policy allows you to discuss the HW problems and statistical concepts
covered with other students, but requires that you complete the HW on your own. You may not
refer to another student's code, or a "common set of code" while writing your own code. You
may, of course, copy/modify lines of code that you saw in lecture, lab, or the course discussion
board and you may consult with TAs, use the Discussion Board, or consult a generative AI tool
regarding code, debugging code, or explaining what code does.

The following discussion of code copying is taken from the Computer Science and Engineering
Department at the University of Washington. You may find this discussion helpful in
understanding the bounds of the collaboration policy.
‘[It is] important to make sure that the assistance you receive consists of general advice that does
not cross the boundary into using code or answers written by someone else. It is fine to discuss
ideas and strategies, but you should be careful to write your programs on your own.

You must not share actual program code with other students. In particular, you should not ask
anyone to give you a copy of their code or, conversely, give your code to another student who
asks you for it; nor should you post your solutions on the web, in public repositories, or any other
publicly accessible place. Similarly, you should not discuss your algorithmic strategies to such
an extent that you and your collaborators end up turning in [essentially] the same code. Discuss
ideas together, but do the coding on your own.
