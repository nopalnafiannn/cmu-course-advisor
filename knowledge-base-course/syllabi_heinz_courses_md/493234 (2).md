Description Television has become a constant in our lives. The variety of unique voices
has produced some of the best storytelling in decades. Some critics have
stated that television is going through a renewed golden age. The
explosion of U.S. scripted content has increased the appetite for original
stories both domestically and internationally. In addition, the expansion of
streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon have further expanded the
global content market. As U.S. networks and distributors seek content,
more opportunities for new voices and new points of view are welcomed.

This introductory class will focus on the fundamentals of writing for
television with an emphasis on the development process, its business
considerations, and writing a television pilot. In addition to covering style
and format, emphasis will be given to story ideas, outlines, structure, and
marketability.

Class Sharing Two of the most fundamental characteristics of television scripts are that
they are:
1) ultimately intended to be produced by a large number of professionals,
including actors, who will bring the dialogue and character behaviors to life;
2) written to be read by others, and if the writer is lucky, the script will go on
to be read by many people. Consequently, this class takes the view that
anyone interested in learning the craft of writing for television must be at
least minimally comfortable (or willing to accept) that the work will be
shared with others as a critical and necessary part of the process.

Though there is no expectation that you will perform dialogue, some of our
assignments and in-class exercises might include having dialogue
referenced aloud as part of a discussion. Work will be shared not only with
the instructor but with one’s classmates. Anything less than complete
respect for the work of every single student, regardless of experience level,
will not be tolerated.

Sharing one’s writing, especially in an educational setting, is an act of trust,
and even the most seasoned professional must frequently conquer their
own feelings of vulnerability. Giving and receiving notes on a script are
fundamental aspects of the writing process. As such, feedback and
critiques will be given -- and accepted -- with maturity, sensitivity, and in
the positive spirit of wishing to help one another grow and improve.

Regardless of the varying degrees of writing experience that each student
brings to this class, the goal here is to advance beyond one’s previous
knowledge and capabilities while learning the fundamental aspects of the
craft of writing for narrative television.

Required TBD. No textbooks are required. Any readings will be provided by the
Viewings & instructor.

Readings
Assignments As this is an introductory class, lessons and assignments may build on one
another, making it difficult to catch up if you fall behind. Additionally, the
importance of the assignments will be more about allowing students to
learn and experience the vocabulary, artistic and technical elements, and
processes of television writing, as opposed to an emphasis on the quality of
output. Effort, intention, and attitude, an interest in the creative aspects
(and how they fit with the business issues), will be given more weight. This is
an opportunity to tap into and explore your own creative impulses and
vision, and you will be encouraged to enjoy the process of creating rather
than stress about the final product. Check Canvas for the most current
assignments and more detailed instructions.

Please note, in previous years, it was clear that many students often skipped
the assigned readings. I firmly believe that reading quality television scripts
is enormously valuable. Therefore, I will be giving mini-quizzes at the
beginning of some class sessions to assess whether or not students have
read the assigned scripts. This practice is not meant to be punitive, but
rather to incentivize students to complete these assignments. The hope is
that you will find these assigned readings both enjoyable and instructive.

These readings will also often form the basis for in-class discussions.

Plagiarism Plagiarism
and cheating Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely
notice* serious matters. Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely
recognized as among the most serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant
when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or as cheating on an examination,
including take‐home as well as in‐class examinations. The punishment for such
offenses can involve expulsion from the MEIM Program and Heinz School.
### Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

● Plagiarism (explained below);
● Submission of work that is not the student’s own;
● Submission or use of falsified data;
● Unauthorized access to an exam or assignment;
● Use of a stand‐in for an exam;
● Use of unauthorized material in the preparation of an assignment or during
an examination;
● Supplying or communicating unauthorized information to another student
for use in an assignment or exam;
● Unauthorized collaboration on an assignment. Collaboration must be
explicitly permitted by an instructor for it to be considered authorized.
● Submission of the same work for credit in more than one course.

Plagiarism is the failure to indicate the source of work either with quotation marks
or footnotes. The source can be a phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific
language, or an idea derived from the work of another person. Note that material on
the web is another person’s work and is therefore equally subject to the rules on
plagiarism and cheating as any other source material.

Cheating and/or plagiarism on an essay assignment will result in a failing grade (0
points) for that assignment. The essay in which the cheating occurs will not be
excluded from the offending student’s assignments included in grade calculations;
the points for that essay zero (0) will be factored into the grade.

A cheating student’s final grade will be impacted significantly. In addition, cases of
cheating and plagiarism will be submitted to and reviewed by the Dean’s Office;
more severe penalties may be imposed, up to and including expulsion from the
Heinz School.

Policy on use Certain assignments in this course will permit the use of generative artificial
of AI intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT. When AI use is permissible, it will be clearly
stated in the assignment prompt posted in Canvas. Otherwise, the default is that
use of generative AI is disallowed. In assignments where generative AI tools are
allowed, their use must be appropriately acknowledged and cited. For instance, if
you generated the whole document through ChatGPT and edited it for accuracy,
your submitted work would need to include a note such as “I generated this work
through Chat GPT and edited the content for accuracy.” Paraphrasing or quoting
smaller samples of AI generated content must be appropriately acknowledged and
cited, following the guidelines established by the APA Style Guide. It is each
student’s responsibility to assess the validity and applicability of any AI output that is
submitted. You may not earn full credit if inaccurate on invalid information is found
in your work. Deviations from the guidelines above will be considered violations of
CMU’s academic integrity policy. Note that expectations for “plagiarism, cheating,
and acceptable assistance” on student work may vary across your courses and
instructors. Please email me if you have questions regarding what is permissible and
not for a particular course or assignment.

Regarding Some of the films and TV shows we will be discussing (as well as those that
Sensitive students create) might examine issues related to race, class, gender, religion,
Materials and sexuality, politics, violence, addiction, etc. If you find yourself uncomfortable with a
Potential particular topic and share this with me with enough advanced notice, I will
Sources of endeavor to find alternative materials that are less upsetting or triggering.

Discomfort However, you will always be free to excuse yourself if for some reason a discussion
(or viewing/reading) brings up personal discomfort. Our classroom is intended to
provide a safe space for you to explore and discuss a wide range of topics and
ideas, and you must do what you need to in order to take care of yourself and your
classmates.

Additionally, this class is designed for mature sensibilities. It is therefore expected
that visual, oral, or written instances of issues such as nudity, sexual activity, use of
alcohol or drugs, etc, will be perceived and/or discussed in a sophisticated manner
that evaluates these issues in the context of their value to a particular story.

Diversity We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this
Statement diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive
campus community. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and
inclusion. It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well served by this course, and that the diversity that students bring
to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit.

Course Absences/Tardiness: We have a lot to cover, so please do your best to attend as
Policies & many classes as possible. Given the individualized nature of writing, I will likely be
Expectations doing many individual meetings with many of you simply to provide feedback on
your work and to address individual needs or concerns. I would like to avoid
additional individual meetings that result from missed classes unless these
absences are the result of unavoidable emergencies. If you know you are going to be
late or must miss a class, please contact me prior to class via email.

Barring a true emergency, absences will be penalized.

Treating writing seriously: This is a graduate-level course, and the standards will
therefore be appropriately set at a professional level. All written submissions must
be proofread thoroughly; typos, grammar, and punctuation will be factored into the
grading of assignments. While no one will get points for submitting work that has
clearly been proofread carefully, or that uses proper grammar and punctuation,
points will be deducted for errors in these areas. While perfection is not expected,
and points will not be deducted for the occasional small error, any submission that
shows a general lack in the aforementioned areas will be penalized.

If you are unsure of your proficiency with grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc, I
strongly suggest you use all the technological tools at your disposal, such as spell
check and programs like grammarly, the latter of which offers a free version:

Mechanics of For the most part, feedback will be given as written notes. Additional feedback can
assignments be given during office hours, which I will be announcing shortly, or during individual
and feedback meetings upon request and at mutually convenient times.

Due dates may be adjusted as I become more familiar with what can be realistically
expected from students in a given time frame and how long I require to read and
provide the necessary feedback which will be helpful before moving onto
subsequent steps in developing the pilot.

Unless you are instructed otherwise, submissions will be uploaded to canvas. I will
be providing further information on this soon, once I have our canvas site more
organized.

Late If an assignment is late by 24/48/72 hours, you are eligible for a maximum of
Submissions 90%/80%/70% of the grade, unless the lateness is due to an emergency about which
you have spoken to me. I will not accept assignments (ie you will receive a score of 0)
beyond a 3rd day of lateness unless you have received my permission in advance.

A NOTE ABOUT THE PACING OF THIS COURSE: What follows is
structured with topics broken into units rather than specific dates of class
sessions. This framework will allow me to organically allot time and
emphasis according to the areas in which they are most (and least)
needed, based on my observations of student comfort and progress.

Though I have due dates listed for many of the assignments, these are,
and will remain, tentative and flexible so that I may adjust them as I feel is
necessary. I retain the right to be similarly flexible with the nature of the
assignments themselves, so that I can adjust based on what I believe will
be most valuable.

I am of the opinion that it is more important that these lessons are learned
in a way that equips students to produce their best work, rather than
strictly adhering to a predetermined timeline, so long as we complete the
most important assignments by the end of the semester.
