### Course Information:

## Section A: 2:00 PM to 3:20 PM, Classroom: HBH 2009

## Section B: 3:30 PM to 4:50 PM, Classroom: HBH 2009

### Course Objectives:

The goal of the course is to integrate technological and managerial aspects of information
technology. Information and communication technologies play multiple roles within businesses,
organizations, industries, and societies:
### *  From a technological perspective, they define the information and communication

infrastructure of the entity and they enable new ways to digitize processes.
### *  From a managerial perspective, they facilitate new coordination and communication

within and across entities, enable new organizational forms, change the information

# 95-422 – Managing Digital Transformation Spring 2025 Page 2 of 9

environment underlying the business, and permit new incentive and monitoring
structures.

Successful efforts at digitization must keep both technological and managerial perspectives in
mind. Using a mix of managerial theory and case analysis, this course will study how the
deployment of information technology changes interactions and processes within organizations,
across organizations, within industries, and across society.
### Given this environment, the course has the following key learning objectives:

### *  Enable students to evaluate the likely impact of future IT innovations on firms and

industries.
*  Identify key drivers of technology’s impact on the business ecosystem.
### *  Formulate appropriate frameworks to categorize technological innovation and its impact

along a variety of metrics including competitive environment, business model disruption
### *  Understand digital product development in practice

### *  Develop business communication skills to effectively communicate recommendations in

both written and spoken forms.

The case analyses will require students to engage in both technical and managerial problem
solving. The technical component of the analysis requires students to understand the technology
for the problems highlighted in the case. The managerial component of the analysis requires
students to analyze the business value and managerial impact of technology, and to address the
change management issues that arise in implementing any digital transformation initiative.
### Course Schedule:

This schedule is subject to change during the semester. All changes will be announced in class or
posted to Canvas.
### Cheating, Plagiarism, and Academic Integrity:

Students at CMU are engaged in preparation for professional activity of the highest standards.

Each profession constrains its members with both ethical responsibilities and disciplinary limits.

To assure the validity of the learning experience, Carnegie Mellon establishes clear standards for
student work. You are required to be familiar with all university policies on this subject (see

# 95-422 – Managing Digital Transformation Spring 2025 Page 3 of 9

http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Cheating.html). A portion of these policies is
reproduced here for emphasis:
In any presentation, creative, artistic, or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to
identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the
basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.
### Cheating includes but is not necessarily limited to:

o Plagiarism, explained below.
o Submission of work that is not the student's own for papers, assignments or
exams.
o Submission or use of falsified data.
o Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam.
o Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination.
o Use of unauthorized material including textbooks, notes or computer programs in
the preparation of an assignment or during an examination.
o Supplying or communicating in any way unauthorized information to another
student for the preparation of an assignment or during an examination.
o Collaboration in the preparation of an assignment. Unless specifically permitted
or required by the instructor, collaboration will usually be viewed by the
university as cheating. Each student, therefore, is responsible for understanding
the policies of the department offering any course as they refer to the amount of
help and collaboration permitted in preparation of assignments.
o Submission of the same work for credit in two courses without obtaining the
permission of the instructors beforehand.

Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, failure to indicate the source with
quotation marks or footnotes where appropriate if any of the following are
reproduced in the work submitted by a student:
o A phrase, written or musical.
o A graphic element.
o A proof.
o Specific language.
o An idea derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another person.

Plagiarism and Generative AI Tools: I encourage students to explore the use of generative
artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, for all assignments and assessments. Any
such use must be appropriately acknowledged and cited, including the specific version of the tool
used. Submitted work should include the exact prompt used to generate the content as well as the
AI’s full response in an Appendix. Because AI generated content is not necessarily accurate or
appropriate, it is each student’s responsibility to assess the validity and applicability of any
generative AI output that is submitted. You may not earn full credit if inaccurate, invalid, or
inappropriate information is found in your work. Deviations from these guidelines will be

# 95-422 – Managing Digital Transformation Spring 2025 Page 4 of 9

considered violations of CMU’s academic integrity policy. Please email me if you have
questions regarding what is permissible and not for a particular course or assignment.

I also wish to inform you that I make use of plagiarism detection tools provided by the
University.

If you believe that a classmate is engaged in an academic integrity violation, you may report that
violation to me (the instructor) or any TA, or if you prefer you can anonymously report
violations to Carnegie Mellon’s “Ethics Reporting Hotline” at 877-700-7050 (for more
information, see: http://www.cmu.edu/hr/eos/forms/carnegie_mellon_hotline_poster.pdf).
### Course Web Site:

Web: https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/45030
We will use the Canvas for course information, reading material and announcements. If you are
registered in the class you should already have access. Your login id is your andrew id and
password.

If you are on the wait list, you should still be able to access the site with your Andrew login
(with the exception of the student resources section). If this does not work, please e-mail the
teaching assistant for your section to obtain temporary access.

The web site has an up-to-date copy of the syllabus, schedule, and any class announcements.

While I will try to make announcements both in class and on the web site, it is a good idea for
you to check the web site regularly. Additionally, the web site has links to class readings and
relevant sites mentioned in class and more extensive background material.
### Reading Materials:

We will use a mixture of HBS cases, supplemental reading materials and podcasts to inform our
classroom discussions. List of readings are posted under each lecture page. You will be given
access to the HBS links in the first two weeks of class.
### Grading and Course Requirements:

You will be evaluated on the basis of your case analyses, in-class discussions, and a take home
final paper.
### The final grade for the course is distributed among various assignments and activities as follows:

# 95-422 – Managing Digital Transformation Spring 2025 Page 5 of 9

## 1. Class Learning Contribution: 30%

## 2. Case Analysis: 20% (each team submits two written case analyses and one class

presentation)
## 3. Project: 30% (Split between midsemester presentation, final presentation and a final write

up)
## 4. Peer Evaluation: 20%

Class Learning Contribution: The quality of our learning environment is contingent on the
effective and informed participation of each class member. The goal here is not to dazzle us with
your individual brilliance or with the number of comments you make, but rather to help make the
class smarter. Note that, in addition to providing new insights to the discussion, it is possible to
make the class smarter by asking the right question or by assimilating comments from other
students or sources. It is also possible to contribute to the class by giving a short presentation
related to your professional experience as it relates to the class material (such presentations
should be discussed with me in advance).

I will be calling on students during class for their thoughts on the reading. This will play a
significant role in class participation grades. Participation during guest lectures (both in person
and over Zoom) will significantly impact the grades. I expect all the students to keep their
cameras turned on during zoom guest lectures to be respectful of the guests who are graciously
spending a significant amount of their time with our class.

In addition, I will try to close each class by asking for someone to summarize the key
“takeaways” of today’s class. Answering this question well is another opportunity to contribute
to our discussion.

The case analyses are designed to help you participate in an effective manner in class. We will
take into account the quality of your comments and your ability to build on and respond to
threads in a conversation about a particular issue in assigning your participation grade.

It is important to note that class contribution is assessed on an individual basis. This is inherently
a subjective assessment but will take the following factors into account:
a. Preparation.
b. Ability to coherently present arguments and to contribute to a discussion.
c. Ability to influence and persuade others in class to agree with your opinions.

Because of the importance of contribution to both your learning and your classmates’ learning, I
am requiring you to turn off your laptops and other electronic devices (tablets, cell phones, etc.)
during class and will take your compliance into account when assigning contribution grades. If
you have a unique situation that necessitates the use of a laptop during class, please contact me
beforehand.

The reason I plan to reduce contribution scores for people who persist in using electronic devices
in class is that research suggests your electronics use can have a negative impact on those around

# 95-422 – Managing Digital Transformation Spring 2025 Page 6 of 9

you. Consider this quote from a paper titled “Laptop multitasking hinders classroom learning for
both users and nearby peers”:
We found that participants who multitasked on a laptop during a lecture scored lower on a test
compared to those who did not multitask, and participants who were in direct view of a
multitasking peer scored lower on a test compared to those who were not. The results
demonstrate that multitasking on a laptop poses a significant distraction to both users and fellow
students and can be detrimental to comprehension of lecture content.

Case Analysis: Each team will have one presentation and one write-up due. Presentation
schedule and the write-up schedule will be posted by week 2 of the class.
### Write-Up:

You case write-up grade is based on a 2-page write-up (double-spaced, 12-point font, 1
inch margins). Cases will be done in teams of 4-5 students. Team assignments will be
available on Canvas. Two pages of exhibits/appendix allowed. You case submission is
due to Canvas by midnight the day before the case is discussed in class.
### Presentation:

Your presentation should address the issues raised in the case narrative and discussion
questions. Teams assigned to present their analysis should limit their presentation to 10
minutes of prepared comments, with an additional 10 minutes of question and answer
time from the class. The team should include enough backup material (including slides)
to answer any questions that might arise about your recommendations.

Peer Evaluation: Since the case analyses are group work, I will use a peer review instrument to
ensure that I take into account feedback from each group member about their fellow teammates’
contribution when I assign the final grade
Project: The objective of the project is to give you hands-on experience in the product
development process. You will get an opportunity to apply the learnings from this class towards
developing a real app prototype. This includes understanding the industry, analyze the industry
for inefficiencies, use technology to address the market inefficiencies. Further, you will study the
value of the product, designing solutions for your users and their problems, and finally delivering
a prototype at the end of the quarter. Use this opportunity and link the YouTube video of your
app’s prototype to your LinkedIn profile and add your teammates. This mini product
management experience will provide great value if you are aiming to be product managers
at some point in your career.
### This project includes the following (more details on Canvas):

# 95-422 – Managing Digital Transformation Spring 2025 Page 7 of 9

1) A mid-semester report focusing on the business and the market side of the digital
product.
2) A final presentation focusing on the technology and the design side of the digital product.
3) Final team written report with specific components.

A Note on Regrade Requests: We make every effort to return graded assignments within 2
weeks of their submission. If you believe that your grade is inaccurate, you may request a
regrade under the following conditions:
## 1. Regrade requests must be submitted within 1 week of the date when the grade was

returned.
## 2. Regrade requests must be in writing and must include a copy of the original assignment.

## 3. Regrade requests must outline the reasons you deserve a higher grade. These will

typically be that the grader misread or misunderstood your answer, or they didn’t take something
into account that they should have. For this, you should use the written comments on the
assignment as your reference point. Referencing another student’s grade is inappropriate and
irrelevant. While we do our best to apply an even standard across students, we can’t discuss
anyone else’s grade with you, so we need to deal with the merits of your particular case.
## 4. I reserve the right to regrade the entire assignment and thus your grade may go up or

down.
## 5. Class contribution grades are inherently subjective and not subject to a regrade request. I

will make notes on participation at the end of each class and assign grades at the end of the
semester based on these notes. I am, however, more than happy to discuss your progress in terms
of class contribution at any point in the semester.
### Take care of yourself:

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this quarter by eating well, getting enough sleep and
taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many
helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the graduate school
experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often
helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like
anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support. I would be more than happy to
talk to you about any issues you are having, either related to the class or simply related to your
life here at CMU. You can also reach out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for
guidance getting connected to the support that can help, or use CMU’s Counseling and
Psychological Services (CaPS) (412-268-2922, http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/).
