# COURSE DESCRIPTION

Success requires active engagement and investment in your life and career. Empowering students with a holistic perspective of their
lives and careers, this seminar-style course will incorporate training elements of professional and career development, leadership
development, and life skills in order to foster optimal professional and personal growth for Master of Arts Management students.

With the guidance of MAM academic and career advisors, MAM students will learn to create both their experience as graduate
students as well as their trajectory into their careers and transition into their roles as alumni. Self-assessment, guest speakers,
lectures, workshops, industry field trips, conferences, and cross-cohort peer experiences will provide the basis for an engaging and
reflective course to cultivate thoughtful investment of this essential component of success.
# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

### By the end of this class, students will:

### *  Understand the job/internship search process including the documents and preparations required to apply for employment

in the U.S.
### *  Effectively introduce yourself in a professional setting at planned and unplanned networking opportunities

### *  Identify various career paths and trajectories across the arts industry

### *  Cultivate strong relationships with peers within and across cohorts that are cross-cultural and interdisciplinary

### *  Recognize biases and power dynamic issues in the employment search process and identify strategies to combat these

issues
### ATTENDANCE, PARTICIPATION and EVALUATION

### This is a pass/fail course. Successful completion of the course means you must meet the following expectations:

*  Attend 80% of sessions. Attending class means physically being present at the Thursday sessions, including workshops,
guest lectures, panels, and other designated activities. If a session of this course is offered remotely, attending remotely will
count towards attendance. (Watching a recording of this class will not count towards attendance.) This semester there will
be 13 classes (including Speaker Series, workshops, and panels). Of the 13 classes, 8 classes are open to both cohorts. There
will be 5 classes specifically for MAM 1s and 1 class specifically for MAM 2s.

MAM 2s Attendance: For attendance purposes, 80% of attendance for MAM 2s for Fall 2024 will mean attending 7
o
classes
80% attendance for MAM 1s will mean attending 10 classes this Fall 2024
o
You will note in the schedule that there are weeks listed as "Both", "MAM 1", and "MAM 1* ". Both means that
o
both cohorts should plan to attend, MAM 1 means only MAM 1s should attend, and MAM 1* means this class is for
MAM 1s but MAM 2s are welcome and should attend if they are interested in the class topic that day.
*  Submit 100% homework assignments on time. Homework is not graded, but must be completed and turned in on time as
specified below in Homework Section.
*  Perform the appropriate deliverables for this semester as noted in the “Checklist for Success”.

Some of the activities on the “Checklist for Success” can be counted as both (e.g., class attendance and attendance
o
at a speaker series). This occurs by design and will make it easy for students to achieve the checklist requirements
and the course attendance minimum.
