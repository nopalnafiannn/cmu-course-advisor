● 12 units
● TA will also have office hours setup.

This course emphasizes practical employment of network security.
### Topics in this course include:

● A working knowledge for the need to design networks
o Properly support an organization
o Properly accommodate networking protocols
o Properly security an organization’s cyber assets through its network
infrastructure
### Learning Objectives:

## 1. Application of security principles to computer networking

## 2. The OSI and TCP/IP models of network communications

## 3. Network security at different layers of the OSI and TCP/IP models

## 4. Enterprise systems for AAA

## 5. Security virtual machine and cloud-based IT infrastructure

## 6. Designing networks on selected protocols to support business operations while maintaining

identified levels of network security
## 7. Supporting secondary network connectivity (wireless, VPNs, BYOD devices, partner

networks, cross-domain and other connectivity types)

## 8. Designing networks to support Resiliency Management, Business Continuity, Disaster

Recovery and other principles to avoid network failures that negatively impact the
organizations ability to deliver on its core mission.
## 9. Methods to prevent, detect and respond to security breaches.

Prerequisites

Course Management
All course materials will be managed through Canvas (www.cmu.edu/canvas). Canvas will be used
to post announcements of assignments and other information. Check frequently to ensure you have
the latest information about the course.

Topical readings that support the course lectures may be added. These readings will be posted
under the course schedule portion of the syllabus. Students are expected to read the material as
part of the course materials. In some cases, these readings will be integrated to homework
assignments.
### Course Updates and Changes

This syllabus represents the course plan as conceived at the beginning of the semester but is subject
to change and modification by the instructor at any time. Advanced notice will be provided to
students through Blackboard announcements, and when necessary, an updated syllabus will be
issued.

External Resources and course videos
Cisco Networking Academy online courses
Cisco Networking Academy self-paced materials will be provided as part of the course. The
Academy courses will cover two different subjects: an introductory course in networking
technologies to teach networking skills, and a course in Cybersecurity Operations used for some
assignments.

VMWare (Fusion pro for Mac or workstation pro for windows) and VirtualBox
This course requires knowledge of installing VMware and VirtualBox. Students should have at least
50GB of available storage and a recommended 16Gb of memory to run these labs.. VMWare is
provided at no cost through CMU. VirtualBox is open source. It is up to the student to notify the
instructor at the beginning of the semester if they don’t have the appropriate resources to run the
labs on their laptop.

If you have a Mac with M2/M3 proc – you will NEED to find an intel-based system to use for labs.

Mac’s with Intel processors or windows laptops only
Assignment Submissions

Assignments will be posted in Canvas. Students are expected to turn in professionally written and
easy to follow documents that is clear and concise which meets the objectives of the assignment.

This includes things like properly formatted title page, appropriate references, relevant screenshots
with sufficient amount of labeling or explanations, etc. Poorly organized documents will result in
point deductions.

Group projects will require ALL students in the group to contribute to the assignment.

Late Submissions
Homework is due at 11:59 PM EST on the assigned due date unless otherwise changed by the
instructor. Penalty for late submissions will result in a 25% reduction in grade per day after the due
date. Assignments more than 4 days late will not be accepted. See the instructor (in advance if
possible) to request exceptions. Extensions on assignments will not be granted unless there are
extenuating circumstances.

Attendance Policy
Unless directed by the university, this course is held in-person in the spring and online in the
Fall. Students are expected to attend class in all cases unless excused by the instructor.

Students need to manage their time appropriately to accomplish all assignments.

Classroom Etiquette
This is a Masters level course taught as part of a professional degree program. Accordingly, you
are expected to conduct yourself in a professional manner during the course, and not engage in
behavior in the class that would be considered unacceptable in the workplace. This includes
appropriate online etiquette in chat sessions or in correspondence with other students. If you
have a question about the content of the lecture, please direct it to me or the Teaching
Assistant. That way, you have a better chance of getting a prompt response. We will all use
‘reply all’ so that we all stay ‘in the loop’ on student correspondence.
### Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism

For any assignment found to be the partial or complete result of cheating or plagiarism, your
grade for that assignment will be zero. Cheating is defined as inappropriate collaboration
among students on an assignment or failure to cite others’ work used in the submissions,
evaluation materials or presentations. This can include copying someone else’s work with or
without alteration. When students are found to be collaborating in this way, ALL
COLLABORATORS will pay the penalty regardless of who originated the work. Please refer to the
University’s policies here: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/StudentPolicy.html

deduction.

Quizzes (10%) –They are worth 10 points each.

The Assignments (30%) – require disk space (50GB or more in some instances)
You also need to be familiar with VMWARE or Virtual Box.

If you have a Mac with M2/M3 proc – you will NEED to find an intel-based system to use for labs.

Midterm (20%) – Project will require applying all knowledge gained thus far.
