BUSINESS WRITING 94-701
# COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course focuses on cultivating effective writing techniques for professionals. Assignments include crafting
persuasive employment correspondence, responding to emails with professional etiquette, and developing
impactful business proposals, memos, and performance evaluations. Since writing is a cumulative skill,
interactive workshops provide an opportunity for participants to share insights and collectively refine their work.

This collaborative environment not only enhances the quality of the assignments, but also fosters a dynamic
exchange of global perspectives, enabling participants to develop a well-rounded understanding of diverse
business contexts.

COURSE OBJECTIVES (using Bloom’s revised taxonomy of learning)
Students will be able to…
Remember: Identify appropriate business formats.

Understand: Demonstrate an understanding of the audience, the purpose, and the message.

Apply: Develop a unified structure, logical connections, and transitional devices.

Analyze: Compare and contrast writing samples (self, peers, and generative AI).

Evaluate: Complete evaluations using a rubric.

Create: Produce documents using professional language, defined voice, and appropriate style.
# IMPORTANCE OF PROFESSIONALISM

As students embark on an exciting semester of professional growth at Heinz College, the importance of
professionalism must be addressed. In the world of academia, as in the professional world, adhering to
deadlines and maintaining high standards are indispensable qualities. Below are a few key reasons why
professionalism matter in this course:
## 1. Accountability: Meeting deadlines establishes accountability for your academic performance. It reflects

your dedication to the subject matter and showcases your ability to manage your time effectively.
## 2. Quality of Work: Adhering to deadlines is conducive to producing high-quality assignments. Rushed or

late submissions often result in subpar work.
## 3. Respect for Others: Submitting work on time demonstrates respect for your peers who rely on shared

contributions for in-class workshops and activities. The act of sharing facilitates efficient and effective
completion of tasks for everyone involved.
## 4. Preparation for the Real World: Cultivating the habit of being punctual for class and submitting work

before deadlines sets the foundation for expectations you'll face in your future career. In a professional
context, tardiness for meetings or late submissions of work can result in missed opportunities, dissatisfied
clients, or even termination of your job.

This semester is an opportunity to develop and practice the essential skills of professionalism that will serve
you well throughout your academic journey and professional career. Remember that by consistently meeting
deadlines and maintaining high standards, you are setting yourself up for a future filled with success and
opportunities.

# NO TEXT REQUIRED

# ACCOMMODATIONS

If you provide evidence of learning for a specific topic and demonstrate an advanced level of proficiency (see
rubric), a more challenging assignment will be provided. Additionally, if you need further assistance to complete
assignments, TA office hours should be attended on a weekly basis.
# OPTIONS FOR DIFFERENTIATION

Throughout the semester, you are provided options to complete a few assignments that correlate with your field
of study or personal interests.
# STANDARDS ALIGNMENT

NASPA Competency 5: To communicate and interact productively with a diverse and changing workforce.
## 5.1 Learning Outcome: Prepare professional/effective documents appropriate to the objective and context.

## 5.3 Learning Outcome: Prepare communications suitable for diverse audiences.

# GENERATIVE AI

https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/technology/aitools/academic integrity/index.html
Certain assignments in this course will permit and encourage the use of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT).

When AI use is permissible, it will be clearly stated in the assignment. Otherwise, generative AI usage is not
allowed. For assignments where generative AI tools are allowed, their use must be appropriately
acknowledged and cited. For instance, if you generated an entire document through ChatGPT and edited it for
accuracy, your submitted work would need to include a note (e.g., I generated this work through Chat GPT and
edited the content for accuracy). Paraphrasing or quoting smaller samples of AI generated content must also be
appropriately acknowledged and cited.

It is your responsibility to assess the validity and applicability of any AI output. If inaccurate on invalid
information is found in the work, you may not earn credit. Deviations from the guidelines listed above will be
considered violations of CMU’s academic integrity policy. Please ask if you have questions regarding what is
permissible for a particular assignment.
# CLASSROOM POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

# ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY

If you plagiarize, you are in violation of academic integrity. Violations of this nature are subject to the
following disciplinary actions: (1) an automatic failing grade is assigned for the work, and (2) the incident is
reported to program administrators. After a thorough review of the incident, administrators determine the
outcome (e.g., failing the assignment (only), failing the course, expelled from school). As a reminder,
generative AI is considered “assistance” as noted in the CMU policy. “Collaboration or assistance on
academic work is not permitted unless explicitly authorized by the course instructor(s).”
### ATTENDANCE & PARTICIPATION POLICY

With interactive in-class workshops, attendance and participation are a requisite part of the learning process. If
you’re close to a higher grade at the end of the semester and you’ve had excellent attendance and participation
with no late or missing assignments, the professor may use discretion with grading. The TA records attendance

at the beginning of every session. If you’re present and on time, it will be noted. Arriving late to class is not
acceptable; it is a disruption to the learning environment, especially after groups engage in writing workshop
activities. You should not email the professor or the TA to provide an excuse for missing class or arriving late.
# EXEMPTION POLICY

Your advisor will discuss options for coursework and recommend a writing class that is appropriate for you
(e.g., Business Writing, Writing for Information Systems, Writing for Public Policy, Writing for Creative
Industries); however, you are welcome to complete the exemption exam. Information about the exam is posted
on the Heinz website.
# GRADING POLICIES

Assignments receive extensive comments and a rubric score (see example rubric included in this syllabus). If
you receive a score that needs further review, you have until the next class to schedule an appointment to
discuss it. After this deadline, the score will not be changed.

Late Work (graded assignments)
All assignments, regardless of your class time, are due by 8:00 a.m. on a specified date. At the deadline, the
Canvas folder for that specific assignment locks and papers are automatically downloaded for review. If you
missed the deadline, a “0” is recorded in the gradebook until the work can be reviewed. Please add your
missing assignment to the “late work” folder. This folder remains open until the deadline for the final. Your
work will be reviewed at the end of the semester and grading starts at 80% of the total points. Please do not
email to ask for an extension and/or request that no penalty be assigned. This is not fair to other students.

Moreover, do not email an assignment; work can only be submitted through Canvas since it is run through a
plagiarism detector. As a reminder, missing class does not warrant additional time to complete an assignment.
### Drafts & Nongraded Assignments

Some assignments (e.g., drafts) receive feedback instead of a grade. Since this work is required for in-class
workshops, failure to submit a draft by the 8:00 a.m. deadline receives an automatic deduction (-15 points).

You did not complete the work; therefore, you cannot fully participate with workshop activities (e.g., giving
and receiving feedback). When a nongraded weekly assignment (e.g., LinkedIn profile) is not submitted, the
same deduction applies. You cannot receive feedback for an assignment that you did not submit. Failure to
complete work in a timely manner (graded or not) demonstrates your lack of effort and participation.

### ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:

# OFFICE HOURS

Office hours are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays (8:30 – 9:30 and 12:30 – 1:30) and by appointment on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
# PARTICIPATION POLICY

Due to in-class writing assignments, a charged laptop is required for all sessions. Computer usage is expected;
however, checking email and/or working on another assignment is not acceptable.
# WAITLIST POLICY

Business Writing is only offered in the fall semester. Since you are placed in this writing course by your
academic advisor, you’ll need permission to switch sections (i.e., mini 1 to mini 2 or vice versa). This course
usually does not have a waitlist since enough sections are offered to meet the needs of first-year students.
