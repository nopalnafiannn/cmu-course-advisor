# LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

We acknowledge that the land we occupy today in and around Pittsburgh has for
centuries been home to Indigenous peoples, including the Adena, followed by the
Hopewell, and later the Monongahela, who occupied the region until the late 17th
century. At the turn of the 18th century, several tribes driven off lands from other parts of
the country traveled through, conducted trade, or settled in the area. We acknowledge
the Haudenosaunee (also known as the Iroquois or the Five Nations peoples
comprising the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca), the Lenape (also
known as the Delaware peoples), the Shawnee, and the Osage peoples, whose
ancestral territory includes this land. We also acknowledge the genocide and forceable
removal of millions of Indigenous peoples from these lands as European colonizers in
the 18th century fought for control of the region. Today, the Pittsburgh area continues to
be home for Indigenous peoples of many nations. We strive to honor their rights,
acknowledge their histories, and work together toward a shared future.
# COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course focuses on elements of exhibition management and introduces students to
the process of planning and implementing exhibitions. With a focus on the people
involved in the exhibition, their job roles and the context of the institution or
organizations involved, the class will examine the many influences involved in the
planning of an exhibition along with the logistical aspects of concept development,
financial planning, and implementation logistics. Special topics will include accessibility
and audience engagement, exhibition controversy, roles within the processes
considered.

Assessments throughout the course intend to build upon one another, ultimately helping
students to develop an exhibition proposal to be used by stakeholders for fundraising,
marketing, and other planning purposes. All students, but especially those that do not
possess a visual arts background, may wish to examine issues present in contemporary
aesthetics through readings (books, periodicals and web) and by asking questions in
class.
# COURSE STRUCTURE

The course will consist of lectures, class discussion, and course-related assignments
that cover a variety of topics important to the exhibition management process. Readings
and online discussions will provide an important foundation on key topics and must be
completed prior to each class. Course-related assignments and other details will be
discussed in each class. Readings and online posts will provide an important foundation
on key topics and must be completed prior to each class. Deadlines for posting are
noted on the class schedule. The final assignment will be an exhibition proposal. All
assignments will be submitted online.

Students will also be required to complete two site visits: one with the class and one
independently. Course-related assignments will assess student learning and intend to
build upon one another, ultimately helping students to present an overall exhibition
proposal as their final project in the course.
# COURSE OBJECTIVES

Skills and knowledge gained through this course will be assessed through readings,
class participation, and assignments. Upon the successful conclusion of the course,
students will be able to:

# COURSE EXPECTATIONS

Statement of Diversity in the Learning Environment: We are diverse in many ways
and this course aims to foster an open and respectful learning environment that builds
and maintains an equitable and inclusive community. Topics covered may be difficult at
times, and it is expected that we approach our discussions with care and empathy. I ask
that we be humble and acknowledge that we all have imperfections, but that we are
committed to supporting a diversity of voices which ultimately shape the perspectives of
all of us. As we work together to create a safe and more inclusive classroom
environment, I ask that we use active listening techniques, remove any peripheral
distractions, reinforce one conversation at a time, remain open to new ways of thinking,
empathize with others’ perspectives, and foster opportunities for feedback that is honest
and intends to bring out the best in one another. Collectively, it is my hope that our
efforts promote diversity, equity, and inclusion and fuel excellence and innovation in our
work.

Course Format and Expectations: The format for this course is designed as “inperson expectation” (IPE) which means that students are expected to attend all classes
in-person in the classroom during the course’s scheduled meeting time. Students are
expected to abide by all behaviors indicated in A Tartan’s Responsibility. Please
regularly review these expectations as they will change from time to time. For more
information, please visit: www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/students/tartans-responsibility.html
Transitioning Our Class to Other Modes of Learning: It is possible that there may be
circumstances that will require the instructor or the University to make a short-term
switch to a fully remote environment. Should any of these circumstances occur, you will
receive an email from the instructor or teaching assistant with an announcement
published on the Canvas site. It is highly recommended that you turn on your Canvas
notifications to ensure you are kept informed.

Time Needed for Assignments/Class Preparation: Students should plan for class
preparation (readings, podcasts, videos, review of prior lecture notes, and/or responses
to online prompts) to take approximately 1-2 hours. Time needed for individual
assignments may vary depending on the assignment, the type of research being
conducted, and the writing and editing time needed. The time it will take to produce your
final project and presentation will vary. In general, engagement in the course material
and planning ahead to conduct research for your written work will help you keep pace
with the assignments and class discussions. Some general tips that might help support
this:
● Read over notes within 24 hours. Consider key concepts, highlight important
words and ideas, take any additional notes, and develop core questions.
● Readings and/or online discussion prompts are assigned in advance of class.

Give yourself enough time to conduct your readings, view related media,
highlight important ideas, respond to question prompts, and consider concepts so
you come to class prepared for discussion.
● Office hours are available to you with some advanced planning. Please make
and appointment and use them productively. Arrive with your questions to help
maximize our time together.

# COURSE POLICIES

Facial Coverings: Establishing a safe campus and classroom environment is critical.

Our in-person class will follow University policies regarding COVID-19. For further
information and requirements, please refer to A Tartan’s Responsibility.

Technology: As research on learning shows, unexpected noises and movement
automatically divert and capture people's attention, which means you are affecting
everyone’s learning experience if your cell phone, laptop, etc. makes noise or is visually
distracting during class.

For this reason, I ask you to silence your mobile devices during class.

You may take notes on your laptop during class, but you must turn the sound off so that
you do not disrupt other students' learning. All personal matters requiring email,
messaging, texts, other homework, etc. must be handled outside of class.

Software: Software in the course will primarily utilize Canvas, Box, and tools available
in the Google suite, such as Docs, Sheets, Drive, Slides. Occasional use of Zoom may
also occur. If you have concerns about utilizing any of these tools, or any of the
hardware previously mentioned, please contact the instructor.

Recordings: Class will not be recorded by the instructor or teaching assistant, and
students are not allowed to record class sessions.

Food/Drink in Class: Please feel free to bring food, bottled water, soda, coffee, or tea
to class. However, please ensure that your food and beverage consumption is done
safely and is not a distraction to others (e.g. noisy wrappers, pungent food, etc.). Please
be sure to clean up after yourself.

Professional Integrity: Students at Carnegie Mellon University are engaged in
preparing for professional activity of the highest standards, including the highest
standards of ethics and integrity. You are expected to have read and understood the
Student Handbook and to conduct yourself in a professional manner both inside and
outside the classroom, particularly as representatives of this course, the Master of Arts
Management Program, Heinz College, and Carnegie Mellon University.

Academic Integrity: Honesty and transparency are important features of good
scholarship. On the flip side, plagiarism and cheating are serious academic offenses
with serious consequences. If you are discovered engaging in either behavior in this
course, you will earn a failing grade on the assignment in question, and further
disciplinary action may be taken.

For a clear description of what counts as plagiarism, cheating, and/or the use of
unauthorized sources and tools, please see the University’s Policy on Academic
Integrity (revised in April 2013): https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/
academic-integrity.html

I encourage you to work together on homework assignments and to make use of
campus resources like Student Academic Success Center (SASC) to assist you in your
pursuit of academic excellence. However, please note that in accord with the
university’s policy you must acknowledge any collaboration or assistance that you
receive on work that is to be graded, either from a person, reference, or a tool (including
AI-generation tools like ChatGPT). So, when you turn in a homework assignments,
please include a sentence at the end that says either:
1. “I worked alone on this assignment.”, or
2. “I worked with __________ [person or tool] on this assignment.” and/or
3. “I received assistance from _________ [person or tool] on this assignment.”
Note that providing this information will only serve to help me understand you better: I
strongly endorse the use of campus resources like SASC, as well as collaborative
learning, when it increases your ability to succeed in this class and when it enhances
your education and learning.

If you have questions about my integration of the university’s policy into this course,
please do not hesitate to ask: my aim is to foster an environment where you can learn
and grow, while ensuring that the work we all do is honest and fair. For more information
about Carnegie Mellon’s standards with respect to academic integrity, you can also
check out the following link: http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/
Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: If you have a disability and are
registered with the Office of Disability Resources, please use their online system to
notify the instructor of your accommodations and make arrangements to discuss your
needs with the instructor as early in the course as possible. The instructor will work with
you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you
may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered
with the Office of Disability Resources, please contact them at
access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Statement of Support for Students’ Health and Well-Being: Take care of yourself.

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs
and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking time to relax. This will help you achieve
your goals and cope with stress. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic
stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, you are strongly
encouraged to seek support.

# GRADING SCALE

Students will be assigned the following final letter grades based on the course
assessment calculations and the “Grading Policies” outlined above. Grading scale for
this course is as follows:
A+ 99 - 100 Exceptional B+ 89 - 90 Good C+ 79 - 80 Poor R Below 71 Failing
A 94 - 98 Excellent B 84 - 88 Acceptable C 74 - 78 Very Poor I Incomplete
A- 91 - 93 Very Good B- 81 - 83 Fair C- 71 - 73 Min Passing
# GRADING POLICIES

Attendance: A great deal of information and guidance is presented during class; Within
the first week of our course, please look ahead and see if you need to miss class for
any excusable reason (religious observance, job interview, university-sanctioned event,
etc.) and notify me as soon as possible.

We may be able to make alternative arrangements for completing assignments.

Everyone is permitted one absence without the deduction of points. If applicable,
students with a formal excuse are still required to post to the Discussion Board by the
due date. If there are extenuating circumstances that require you to miss class
repeatedly or for an extended period, please come and discuss this issue with me so I
can assist in connecting you with the appropriate support.

If you do not use this absence, then the extra points you earn will be added to your
lowest homework score when computing your final grade (i.e., extra credit).
### Late Arrivals/Leaving Early/Frequent Class Departures:

At the start of every class, we will have a 10 minute grace period to get settled before
class begins. Likewise, after our mid-point break, we will have a 5 minute grace period.

Arriving late beyond those grace periods, leaving early disrupts the class. Two instances
of arriving late, leaving mid-class, leaving early without permission will count as one
absence. If there are extenuating circumstances that require a student to arrive late,
leave mid-class, or leave early, please make arrangements to discuss the matter with
me in advance.

Missed Classes: Students are responsible for any material they miss in class. Please
review Canvas and arrange contact with a classmate who can inform you of any missed
material, or please contact the instructor in advance of any foreseeable absences, as
outlined in the attendance policy, so that you may continue your course work.
### Assignments and Late Work:

Due dates for every assignment are provided on the course syllabus and posted in
Canvas. Unless otherwise stated, assignments are due on those days. Assignments in
this course build on each other, so timely submissions are crucial to your progress in the
class and submissions are due via Canvas when noted.

To accommodate the surprises that happen to all of us, you are allotted one flex day.

This flex day allows you to submit an assignment up to two days late without penalty.

You can use this day for any assignment and for any reason. You do not need to provide
me with the reason: simply email me and tell me that you need to use your flex day.

Once you’ve exhausted your flex day, then point deductions will occur for any
assignment submitted after the deadline. Late assignments will not be accepted unless
the student has secured permission from the instructor PRIOR to the assignment’s due
date. Work received late (within the first 24 hours of the due date) without prior
permission will be accepted at the instructor’s discretion for a 25% reduction and then
graded appropriately. Work received late (within the first 48 hours of the due date)
without prior permission will be accepted at the instructor’s discretion for a 50%
reduction and then graded appropriately. Late work beyond 48 hours will not receive
credit.
