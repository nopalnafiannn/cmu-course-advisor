# 95807 Object Oriented for Managers - Syllabus for Spring 2025

Course Title: 95807 Object Oriented Programming for Managers
Course
*  Instructor: Neelam Dwivedi (ndwivedi@andrew.cmu.edu ).
information
### *  Office Hours: By appointment

Prerequisites Basic programming knowledge
The course provides an overview of computer programming concepts and objectoriented thinking using the Java programming language. Students will be introduced
to general programming concepts such as loops and recursions as well as the
Description specific object-oriented themes of methods, classes, and inheritance. The goal is
for the student to cultivate an appreciation and understanding of the impact of
these concepts and themes on the management of large-scale software
development projects
### Reference Textbook (supplemental):

### *  Core Java Vol 1 - Fundamentals

*  Head First Java: Sierra and Bates.
### Software (required):

### *  Best option: JDK 21:

materials
Make sure that every time you create a new Project in Eclipse, you
o
choose the option NOT to create a module or module-info.java.
*  Eclipse IDE: https://eclipseide.org/
Note: You may choose some other IDE as per your convenience. However, most of
the videos in this course and instructions in the content use Eclipse. If you decide to
use some other IDE, you will need to figure out how to use tools such as JUnit and
JavaFX in it.

### *  Use a Java IDE as well command line to test code snippets and author

professional programs.
*  Learn Java language basics, including types, operators and program control.
### *  Develop problem solving skills through practice and understanding of the

divide-and-conquer and top-down approaches.

Learning /
course
*  Form and manipulate collections of data (such as lists, dictionaries, tuples).
objectives
### *  Learn the principles of object oriented programming in Java with usage of

classes, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces - with the goal of
understanding code reuse and building scalable programs.
### *  Be exposed to the SDLC (software development lifecycle) to understand

how software applications are authored in industry. This includes basic UML
usage and design concepts.

policies
### *  Please understand that if you plan to submit an assignment too close to the

due date / time, it is your decision. You must keep sufficient buffer for any
last minute surpirses, such as laptop / wireless technology issues.
### A typical week in this course will have several activities:

Videos & Self-assessments: There is a significant part of course-content provided
Course
in the form of videos that you must watch before the beginning of each week. You
activities
are expected to perform three graded activities after watching each week’s videos
before Sunday midnight.
# 95807 Object Oriented for Managers - Syllabus for Spring 2025

### *  Complete weekly self-assessment based on the video-content for which you

will get two attempts. The higher of the two scores will be considered for
grading.
*  Give feedback in weekly Feedback Survey (FS). Your input will be visible only
to the Instructor and the TA.
### *  Participate in class discussion through Discussion Posts (DP) to share your

thoughts with the class.

Lab: There are nine lab-assignments through the semester. Each lab is a
programming problem related to the topic you covered in videos and selfassessments in the previous week. You will submit a Java program before the end of
the week. Top 8 lab scores will be considered for your final grade. You can consult
with me or the TA(s) if you need help in labwork. First two labs (Lab0A and Lab0B)
will not be graded.

Class Quiz (CQ): There are nine 10-minutes timed-quizzes that test your
understanding about the material covered in the videos and the labs. Top 8 quiz
scores will be considered for your final grade.

Homework: There are 3 homework assignments and all three will be considered for
your final grade. You will be given approx. two weeks to complete each HW
submission

### Students with Disabilities:

Our community values diversity and seeks to promote meaningful access to educational
opportunities for all students. CMU and your instructors are committed to your success and to
supporting Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended and the Americans with
Disabilities Act (1990). This means that in general no individual who is otherwise qualified shall be
excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
program or activity, solely by reason of having a disability.
# 95807 Object Oriented for Managers - Syllabus for Spring 2025

If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact us ASAP, and we will
work together to ensure that you have the correct access to resources on campus to assist you
through your coursework and time at CMU.
### Academic Integrity:

Carnegie Mellon University sets high standards for academic integrity. Those standards are
supported and enforced by students, including those who serve as academic integrity hearing
panel members and hearing officers. The presumptive sanction for a first offense is course failure,
accompanied by the transcript notation “Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.” The standard
sanction for a first offense by graduate students is suspension or expulsion. Please see
http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/ for any questions. You are responsible for being familiar
with the university standard for academic honesty and plagiarism.
### Specifics for this course:

All labs, quizzes, and homework are meant to be your individual work. Copying from any source
without citation, sharing your work with other students, or copying from other students will be
considered as cheating and will be addressed according to the university policies. In order to deter
and detect plagiarism, online tools and other resources are used in this class.
### *  Acceptable

### *  You may discuss the requirements of the assignment, but not specifics, such as code

### *  You may refer to code samples from the textbook, lectures and class handouts

### *  Not Acceptable and Considered Cheating

### *  You may not discuss specific code in labs and homework

### *  You may not look at or copy other’s assignment code, in whole or in part

### *  You may not have someone else write code for you

### *  You may not copy code you find on the web

### *  You may not submit another’s work as your own

### *  You may not have in your possession other students’ assignments or exams from the

current or past semesters
### *  You may not share your assignment code with others

### *  You may not use an alternate, stand-in, or proxy during an exam

### *  You may not receive help from someone else during an exam

If students are found to be sharing code, both the student who shared their code and the student
who used the code will be found in violation of the academic integrity policy. All students involved
will be penalized equally.
### Policy Regarding Students Using English as a Foreign Language:

# 95807 Object Oriented for Managers - Syllabus for Spring 2025

Assignments in this course are graded with reference to evidence of the acquisition of concepts,
presentation format, and accuracy of information. Having done business in countries that use
languages other than English, we understand that the use of an unfamiliar language can result in
unusual word choices or grammatical errors that are not critical to the overall understanding of the
information. Therefore, we will take into account your need to function in a language that may be
unfamiliar to you. We will provide feedback as appropriate if we feel that language or grammar you
have used in assignments would be best if it were configured in a different way.
### Use of Canvas System for this course:

In this course, we will use the Canvas system generally to post lecture notes and related
documents and to receive assignments electronically from students. To access Canvas, go to
