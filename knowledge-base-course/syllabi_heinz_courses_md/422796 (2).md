Student Well-being: Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this
semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking
some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources
available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for
help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or
feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and
Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website
http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member
you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.

Diversity and Inclusion: We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many
ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive
campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including
but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation,
gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of
these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our
students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity,
equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we
want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the
work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that
increasingly embraces these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or
unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and
groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or
observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support,
within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these
experiences using the following resources:
*  Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
*  Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: reportit.net username: tartans
password: plaid
All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any
following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to
transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.

Course Objectives: The objective of this course is to provide students with a solid introduction
to the principles of transportation system analysis with the focus on planning and traffic
operation. The material learned will provide the basic skill set that will allow students of either
engineering or public policy background to solve transportation problems that are likely to
appear in professional practice, on the Fundamentals of Engineering exam (FE), and in
development of transportation policies. The material also serves as foundation for future
coursework in transportation and smart communities.

This course covers fundamentals of planning and operation of roadway transportation.

Topics covered include basic traffic flow theory, traffic signal design and evaluation,
transportation planning, transit planning, and basic data analytics techniques. The objective is to
develop the capability to: 1) understand the principles of transportation planning and system
management; 2) analyze transportation systems with emerging mobility data; and 3) apply
methodologies to solve transportation system problems and develop management
strategies/policies.
### Grades:

Homework 50% (10% each)
Term Project 30%
Final (a written reflection) 20%
Grading: Homework can be submitted in class or Canvas. Feedback and scores will be returned
to you in the following week of submission. If you would like to have it re-graded, please contact
the TA who grade it to resolve this issue. Please ask for re-grading of an assignment within one
week after it is returned to you in the first place.

Homework Submission Policy: No late homework will be accepted after the due time unless
previously arranged with me 48 hours prior to the deadline. Three additional days will be
extended after the arrangement. No late homework will be accepted after the solutions are posted
to Canvas. No exception.

Academic Honesty: As a CMU student, you have agreed to abide by CMU's policies on ethics
and discipline, which can be found in http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/. No cheating and
plagiarism will be tolerated.

Using information directly from websites, books, papers and other literary sources
without appropriate attribution is plagiarism. Assignments submitted for this class will be
reviewed by the instructor and TAs and may be scanned through web-based academic integrity
software. Occurrences of cheating or plagiarism will be handled according to the university
policy on Cheating and Plagiarism, https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-studentlife/academic-integrity.html. Students are expected to have read this policy and conform to the
highest standards of academic integrity. For incidents of academic misconduct, the University
Academic Disciplinary Actions Policy, found at https://www.cmu.edu/studentaffairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html, will be followed.

Artificial Intelligence: AI language models, such as ChatGPT, can only be used to improve
writing. Students cannot use AI language models to generate answers and solve problems for
their assignments directly. Students who use AI language models to improve their writing should
have a clear statement in the final section of their assignments. Students are responsible for fact
checking statements composed by AI language models. Unattributed use of AI language models
are forms of scholastic dishonesty and will be treated as such.

Homework: Homework must be individual work unless otherwise stated. Discussions with other
students about concepts and overall approaches to completing individual assignments are
permitted, but you must do individual problem solving and derive your own solutions, including
your own computer work.

You are not permitted to be in possession of any assignments from another student or
other source either from the current semester or from past semesters whether they are electronic
or paper. Possession of or sharing such files constitutes an infraction of the academic integrity
policies of this course.
