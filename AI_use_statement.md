## AI Use Statement

This project utilized generative AI tools to enhance development efficiency and support various aspects of the work. As required by the course policy on AI tool usage, this statement documents all AI assistance received during this project.

### Tools Employed
- OpenAI Codex CLI: Released on April 16, 2025, Codex CLI is an open-source coding tool designed to run locally in terminal environments. It was used within Visual Studio Code to assist in generating and debugging Python scripts related to document chunking, embedding course syllabi, constructing and testing Haystack RAG pipelines, implementing BM25 and hybrid retrievers, and computing evaluation metrics such as Precision@K, Recall@K, ROUGE, and BLEU.
- Claude Code (Anthropic): Introduced in February 2025 alongside Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude Code is an agentic command-line tool that enables developers to delegate coding tasks directly from their terminals. It was engaged via its web interface to refine documentation, develop prompt templates, summarize evaluation results, and provide guidance on architectural decisions and improvements.

All AI-generated content was critically reviewed and edited to ensure accuracy and relevance to the project's objectives.

### Complete Transcript
As required by the course policy, a sample transcript of interactions with AI tools (including all prompts and outputs) is provided in Appendix A of the final report. This transcript documents every instance where generative AI was used during the development of this project, ensuring full transparency and compliance with academic integrity requirements.
