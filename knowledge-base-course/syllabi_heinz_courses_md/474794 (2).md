### Master of Entertainment Industry Management

Course FANDOM in MUSIC and MEDIA – CLASS 93.859 (FALL 2024)
Information September 7th: 2:30-5:30pm; September 14th: 2:30-5:30pm; September 21st: 2:30-5:30pm
Instructor: Alisa Ben alisaben77@gmail.com
Description Fandom and all forms of entertainment are inextricably tied. From the earliest development of
human expression to the technologically diverse present: visuals, performances, games, music,
fiction, and play of all kinds, have catered to and been
funded/supported/disseminated/worshiped/appropriated by FANS (casual or rabid). Music, Sports,
Politics (increasingly), Movies, TV/Streaming, Video Games, Social Media Platforms themselves,
are all arguably the most influential methods in history for exposing audiences to new
artists/celebrities/micro-celebrities/ideas/heroes/villains. Fandom has become more than content
consumption. The role of FANS can, and often does, serve as the key driver of creative decisions
and the entertainment business.

The goal of this class is to provide students with the broadest understanding of the landscape of
FANDOM today and historically, as well as the role it plays from the POV of decision makers and
those that finance and produce content on the corporate level.

We will also focus on the resources and processes for discovering
artists/influencers/leaders/celebrities, mobilizing FANS as business strategies, navigating the
process of FAN engagement effectively, and pushing the role of FANDOM (and artists
themselves) in broad strategic thinking beyond the final produced project.
### Learning/Course By the end of the course, students should be able to:

Guest Speakers I will have occasional guest speakers. The guest speakers will only be presented if they have
something interesting to say and are leaders in their field. You will have the opportunity to submit
questions either prior to the guest speaker or after they have presented to the class–please come
prepared to use them as a resource for your final project during this time.

Absences/Tardy: Attendance is mandatory and will be reflected in the class participation portion of your grade. If
you know you are going to be late or absent, please contact me prior to class via email (above).

Copy Mary and Dan. Each unexcused absence, unexcused lateness or unexcused early exit from
class will result in a one-third step down in grade (e.g., A- to B+).

Course Materials There will be no formal text but I will hand out or post to the class Box folder assigned readings.

Outline
Class 1: Saturday, September 7th: 2:30-5:30pm
Topic The theory-based class will focus on the evolution of FANDOM and
introduce a broad ‘state of the entertainment business’ and narrow the focus
to FANDOM across Entertainment & media. The expectation is to come to
class with some self-directed research in areas outlined in deliverables. We
will investigate various projects that inspire and exemplify successful
FANDOMS across all entertainment and media and their devotion (“good”
or “bad”). This class is heavily weighted on in-class participation, healthy
debate, and innovative ideas and philosophies of FANDOM.

Required Personal research in the area of specific FAN BASES and FAN movements.

Readings

Deliverable Individual Assignment – Students are required to select a subject that meets

2-page example more than two pages on FANDOM. It should identify the subject of the
of FANDOM FANDOM, what it is (e.g., Taylor Swift’s “Swifties”), why you selected this
including social particular FANDOM, an example of what it does extraordinarily well or
links poorly. Please use the FANDOM category descriptions/questions to guide
your selection. Students must include links to socials for their subject and a
general overview of the category or market the subject is in if outside
Entertainment—any industry is fine.

Students should be prepared to succinctly speak to it in class if called upon.

Class 2: Saturday, September 14th: 2:30-5:30pm
Topic We will lay out relevant concepts related to the business of FANDOM in
terms of business research/data and discuss applications of them in real world
entertainment business settings. We will likely have a guest speaker sharing
their expertise in the field.

Plagiarism and Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are viewed as extremely serious
cheating notice* matters. Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most
serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required
paper or as cheating on an examination, including take-home as well as in-class examinations. The
punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the MEIM Program and Heinz School.
### Cheating includes but is not limited to:

## 1. Plagiarism (explained below);

## 2. Submission of work that is not the student’s own;

## 3. Submission or use of falsified data;

## 4. Unauthorized access to an exam or assignment;

## 5. Use of a stand‐in for an exam;

## 6. Use of unauthorized material in the preparation of an assignment or during an examination;

## 7. Supplying or communicating unauthorized information to another student for use in an

assignment or exam;
## 8. Unauthorized collaboration on an assignment. Collaboration must be explicitly permitted by an

instructor for it to be considered authorized.
## 9. Submission of the same work for credit in more than one course.

Plagiarism is the failure to indicate the source of work either with quotation marks or
footnotes. The source can be a phrase, a graphic element, a proof, specific language, or an idea
derived from the work of another person. Note that material on the web is another person’s work
and is therefore equally subject to the rules on plagiarism and cheating as any other source
material.

Cheating and/or plagiarism on an essay assignment will result in a failing grade (0 points) for
that assignment. The essay in which the cheating occurs will not be excluded from the offending
student’s assignments included in grade calculations; the points for that essay zero (0) will be
factored into the grade.

Furthermore, the cheating student’s final grade will be reduced one full letter grade. A cheating
student’s final grade will be impacted significantly. In addition, cases of cheating and plagiarism
will be submitted to and reviewed by the Dean’s Office; more severe penalties may be imposed, up
to and including expulsion from the Heinz School.

Academic Dishonesty: Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards inside and
outside the classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e., plagiarism and unauthorized
collaboration) is obviously discouraged and will be treated appropriately. The usual penalty for
violations is a failing grade for the particular assignment in question; however, in some instances,
such actions may result in a failing grade for the course.

Artificial Any use of generative AI for any graded component of this course is explicitly prohibited. Using
Intelligence ChatGPT or other generative AI to generate any course content will be considered an academic
Policy: integrity violation.
# FANDOM GROUPS

Emerging: Fandoms that are growing either in engagement, popularity or with revenue stream opportunities. How
do you take it into Stardom? Superstardom?

Maintaining: When you’re on top the only way to go is down, or is it? Superstardom is hard to maintain so how do
you grow audiences, improve/optimize your brand, stretch Fandoms to create an icon status and maintain as long
as possible?

Risk Management: When Fandoms get too passionate and go too far/become toxic. What is too far? Can you turn
it around? Do you lean into it and double down?
