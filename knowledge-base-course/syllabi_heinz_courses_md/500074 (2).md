Course Objectives
1.-Knowledge and Content
The driving theme of the course is to understand the nature of the U.S political system
and the role that the main institutions play in determining the rights of the citizens. Is this
a republic, a democracy? If a democracy, a democracy for all or for some? These
questions will be answered by looking at fundamental rights such as the right to vote, the
right to marry, and the right to certain basic social services among others. In the final
analysis, it is in the interaction between politics and policies that these assessments
will be made.

To understand how democracies work and survive, we need to understand the role of the
critical institutions: congress, the presidency, and the courts. We need to understand how
they all have protected and undermined certain rights in the past and now, and how they
impact society. We’ll begin with an analysis of voting rights which allows us to
determine who will govern us. The second section focuses on the role of the Supreme
Court, a non-elected institution, which has the power to determine the right to vote, the
powers of the branches of government, and the rights of all those who live in the United
States. The third section focuses on the societal and racial impact of some of our most
critical socioeconomic policies including health, welfare, social security among others.

In brief, following Abraham Lincoln, this course’s premise is that “the legitimate object
of government is to do for the people what needs to be done, but which they cannot,
by individual effort, or do so well for themselves” (Jon Meacham, And there was
Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle, Kindle version).

2.-Structure of the course
The first section of the course will focus on the powers of the executive and legislative
branches and the issues affecting congress. The growth of presidential power and
congressional polarization are the essential topics of this section. The second section will
analyze the “embattled right to vote” and will provide both a historical overview of the
evolution of voting rights as well as current challenges. The third section will focus on
the Supreme Court’s role in defining our rights including the right to free speech, gay
rights, reproductive rights, and the most essential of all: Equal Protection under the Laws,
guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. The fourth section will allow us to analyze the
“hidden rules of race” and their impact on economic exclusion, as well as selected
policies that might have the power to repair the exclusion. Among those are heath
policies, welfare, social security, the wealth and employment gaps and housing. Students
will be encouraged to do presentations on topics not covered in the previous sections.

3.-Skills
The course emphasizes the development of qualitative analytical skills. Students will
develop these analytical skills in three different forms and through four different
processes:
a) Class discussions and doing a summary of the readings will allow the students
to develop the ability to analyze and discuss the readings in an academic
environment.
b) Writing policy memos: It is critical for all of us to be able to analyze a problem
and recommend policies/solutions to others. The policy memos allow the students
to develop these very important skills. Students are expected to assume the role of
a policy maker and provide specific policies recommendations. The policy memos
emphasize the use of relevant data, the analysis of the problem, and the policy
design.

Detailed memo guidelines will be provided to the class with each memo
prompt.
c) Group presentations and paper: Group presentations are geared to allow the
student to develop the ability to work on a project with two or three other
students, learn about a specific topic in depth, and prepare an effective and wellstructured presentation. The presentation will be followed by a group paper which
needs to be structured as an analytic professional paper. Detailed instructions
will be sent to each group to accomplish this goal and provide the students
with a specific learning experience.

4.-Conclusion:
At the end of the course the student is expected to have learned about the specific
institutions and policies included in the syllabus and the principles and actors that inform
those policies. Students will also develop a set of analytical, presentation, and writing
skills that will be used in a professional setting.

Class Requirements

To ensure the effectiveness of the presentation the instructor will meet with the group
about two weeks before the presentation to define the parameters of the presentation. A
draft of the slides needs to be submitted to the instructor at least 48 hours before the
presentation. The instructor will review the slides to verify the effectiveness of the
presentation and comments will be sent to the group.

Additional Information
Take care of yourself.

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will
help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are
many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college
experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is
often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or
feelings such as anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and
visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend,
faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can
help.

Here is information about the Student Academic Success Center (SASC)
SASC focuses on creating spaces for students to engage in their coursework and
approach learning through a variety of group and individual options. We offer many
opportunities for students to deepen their understanding of who they are as learners,
communicators, and scholars. Our services and workshops are free to the CMU
community and meet the needs of all disciplines and levels of study. SASC programs to
support student learning include the following (program titles link to webpages):
● Academic Coaching--This program provides holistic, one-on-one peer support and
group workshops to help undergraduate and graduate students implement habits for
success. Academic Coaching assists students with time management, productive
learning and study habits, organization, stress management, and other skills. Request
an initial consultation here.
● Peer Tutoring--Peer Tutoring is offered in two formats for students seeking support
related to their coursework. Drop-In tutoring targets our highest demand courses
through regularly scheduled open tutoring sessions during the fall and spring
semesters. Tutoring by appointment consists of ongoing individualized and small
group sessions. You can utilize tutoring to discuss course related content, clarify and
ask questions, and work through practice problems. Visit the webpage to see courses
currently being supported by Peer Tutoring.
● Communication Support--Communication Support offers free one-on-one
communication consulting as well as group workshops to support strong written, oral,
and visual communication in texts including IMRaD and thesis-driven essays, datadriven reports, oral presentations, posters and visual design, advanced research,
application materials, grant proposals, business and public policy documents, data
visualisation, and team projects. Appointments are available to undergraduate and
graduate students from any discipline at CMU. Schedule an appointment (in-person
or video), attend a workshop, or consult handouts or videos to strengthen
communication skills. Specific resources for multilingual students are also available.
● Language and Cross-Cultural Support--This program supports students seeking
help with language and cross-cultural skills for academic and professional success
through individual and group sessions. Students can get assistance with writing
academic emails, learning expectations and strategies for clear academic writing,
pronunciation, grammar, fluency, and more. Make an appointment with a Language
Development Specialist to get individualized coaching.
● Supplemental Instruction (SI)--This program offers a non-remedial approach to
learning in historically difficult courses at CMU. It utilizes a peer-led group study
approach to help students succeed and is facilitated by an SI leader, a CMU student
who has successfully completed the course. SI offers a way to connect with other
students studying the same course, a guaranteed weekly study time that reinforces
learning and retention of information, as well as a place to learn and integrate study
tools and exam techniques specific to a course. Visit the website to see courses with
SI available here.
### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources
office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in
the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are
provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit
from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I
encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

Writing Support: Feel free to get in touch with the Global Communication Center
(GCC) if you need writing support. You can schedule appointments by emailing the gcccmu@andrew.cmu.edu
